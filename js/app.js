Appearance and voidness are experienced in a state of non-duality.<br/><br/>When the conflicting emotions and their habitual propensities are cleared, you will be able to see that your primordial nature is perfectly pure, and that this purity is the nature of existence and the nature of each and every one of us.<br/><br/>When you are able to become free from the stain of dualistic grasping and clinging, through the practice of the view, meditation, and conduct, you will then realize the all-pervasive purity of phenomenal existence and that the primordial nature of each and every sentient being is that of a perfect buddha.', author: 'Yangthang Tulku Rinpoche'},

They felt that if they didn’t bring it to mind in the morning they were in danger of wasting the entire afternoon, and if they didn’t bring it to mind in the afternoon they were in danger of wasting the whole night.

Many animals spend their lives in caves or in the ground like groundhogs, just eating and shitting without practicing Dharma. The Buddha said that people who go on retreat without first understanding real Dharma have the solitude of a demon’s hook. The same is true for those who understand Dharma but have no intention of benefiting sentient beings, just wanting to go from samsara’s suffering to samsara’s vacation. When people who have spent time in solitude without understanding come out of retreat, only hair, beards, and fingernails are longer; otherwise, everything is the same.
