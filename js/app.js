		{quote: 'Smiling is very important. If we are not able to smile, then the world will not have peace. It is not by going out for a demonstration against nuclear missiles that we can bring about peace. It is with our capacity of smiling, breathing, and being peace that we can make peace.', author: 'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
		{quote: 'The ultimate definition of bravery is not being afraid of who you are.', author: 'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Just as the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt, so also this teaching and discipline has one taste, the taste of liberation.', author: 'Buddha'},

		{quote: 'Generosity is the most natural outward expression of an inner attitude of compassion and loving-kindness.', author: '14th Dalai Lama'},
		{quote: 'The literal meaning of guru yoga is ‘union with the teacher´s nature\'. To blend your mind with the teacher\'s mind is the most profound of all practices, and the shortest path of realization. It is the life force of the path and the one practice that includes all others. It was through relying on a spiritual teacher that all the bodhisattvas of the past generated the mind of enlightment and reached perfection.', author: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'By eliminating the self-pitying imagination of ego, you go beyond fear. All fear and other self-pitying emotions come from holding a self-pitying image of yourself.', author: 'Lama Yeshe'},
		{quote: 'Death could come any minute so transform your life into dharma.', author: 'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'As it is explained in many of the meditation teachings, first of all you cannot stop thoughts. It is impossible. And stopping thoughts is not our agenda. It is not doable. Even if were do-able it is not necessary, it is useless. Meditation actually is to generate the awareness of the thought. If you are supposed to develop the awareness of the thought, then you have to have the thought to be aware of! So you can\'t really get rid of the thought and then try to look at something.', author: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Like the illusory face of this appearing world,<br />The movement of mind is not touched by artifice;<br />It is not altered by action, freedom, or realization.<br />To remain in the depths of mind free of reference<br />Is known as mahamudra.', author: '17th Karmapa'},

		{quote: 'Our ultimate essence and our ultimate primordial nature is limitless freedom.', author: 'Tai Situ Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Our life passes, and the fact that it can end at any moment means we are in a most precarious and dangerous situation.', author: 'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Instead of struggling against the force of confusion, we could meet it and relax. When we do that, we gradually discover that clarity is always there. In the middle of the worst scenario of the worst person in the world, in the middle of all the heavy dialogue with ourselves, open space is always there.', author: 'Pema Chödrön'},
		{quote: 'A learned person will become noble only when he or she has put into practice what has been learned, instead of just mere words.', author: '14th Dalai Lama'},
		{quote: 'Smiling is very important. If we are not able to smile, then the world will not have peace.

It is with our capacity of smiling, breathing, and being peace that we can make peace.', author: 'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
		{quote: 'It is easy enough to be friendly to one\'s friends. But to befriend the one who regards himself as your enemy is the quintessence of true religion. The other is mere business.', author: 'Mahatma Gandhi'},
		{quote: 'There\'s no difference between what is seen and the mind that sees it.', author: 'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Virtue, concentration, and wisdom together make up the Path. But this Path is not yet the true teaching, not what the teacher actually wanted, but merely the Path that will take you there. For example, say you traveled the road from Bangkok to Wat Pah Pong; the road was necessary for your journey, but you were seeking Wat Pah Pong, the monastery, not the road. In the same way, we can say that virtue, concentration, and wisdom are outside the truth of the Buddha but are the road that leads to truth. When you have developed these three factors, the result is the most wonderful peace.', author: 'Ajahn Chah'},
		{quote: 'Appreciate and rejoice, without any expectation. It doesn\'t matter if people are unkind to you, it doesn\'t matter if people betray you, it doesn\'t matter if people don\'t even say \'thank you\' to you; by appreciating everything around you, from happy experiences to sad, your life will become meaningful, full of understanding, joy, strength and fearlessness.', author: 'Gyalwang Drukpa'},
		{quote: 'It is because of bodhicitta that one gives up<br />the pleasure of meditative concentration,<br />and in order to relieve others of their suffering<br />goes down to the deepest hell as if into a pleasure park.', author: 'Khunu Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'The true bodhisattva spirit grows out of this personal sense of freedom. You discover that you don\'t feel so needy anymore. You don\'t crave another refueling – with shamatha or with other people\'s love and attention – because you know within yourself how to be free, how to be confident. With this sense of security and freedom, you begin to direct your attention to the needs of others. The compassion expands.', author: 'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Virtues are acquired through endeavor,<br />Which rests wholly upon yourself.<br />So, to praise others for their virtues<br />Can but encourage one\'s own efforts.', author: 'Nagarjuna'},
		{quote: 'Someone who has been captured with a hook has no option but to go wherever he is led. In the same way, if we catch hold of our mind – which risks being distracted by the objects of the six senses – with the hook of mindfulness, and with vigilance and carefulness, this will be of enormous benefit. We should use this watchman to constantly check how many positive or negative thoughts and actions we produce during the day. When we are able to control our minds through mindfulness, everything that appears in samsara and nirvana becomes an aid in our practice and serves to confirm the meaning of the teachings. All appearances are understood as being dharmakaya. We perceive everything in its natural purity, and there is nothing we can call impure.', author: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Clouds draw water from the ocean to fall as rain on the earth<br />And there is neither increase nor decrease;<br />Just so, reality remains unaltered like the pure sky.', author: 'Saraha'},
		{quote: 'We may say we can only believe in what can be experienced or proven, but actually we believe selectively in what can be experienced or proven as long as it is compatible with our other conceptions. We accept and use intangible abstractions of intangible times, places, and circumstances to support what we think is tangibly true, turning intangible to the tangible through our conception. Because we are only interested in our version of reality, we miss the potential opportunity to connect tangible qualities to intengible qualities through wisdom\'s influence.', author: 'Thinley Norbu Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'In the current general cultural milieu of the Western world, expression of desire allows emotions to be actively encouraged, actively stimulated, and over-blown, all within the contextual appreciation of this as something healthy. If one has a desire, one is encouraged to fulfill it. If one has an emotion, one is encouraged to stimulate it, to bring it to development by expressing it. Generally, this is seen as a healthy thing to do, while actually, in terms of karmic development, this approach tends to create a disproportionate exaggeration of desire and attachment.', author: 'Kalu Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'The Buddha taught that the mind is responsible for us attaining Buddhahood and mind is also responsible for us wandering in samsara. The Buddha has said that the mind is like an artist who paints whatever they want. The mind uses the five mental aggregates of form, feeling, identification, formation, and consciousness to create whatever is perceived in the world.', author: 'Thrangu Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That\'s the message he is sending.', author: 'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
		{quote: 'Magic is the power within oneself. You have enough strength, exertion and energy to view things as they are, personally, properly, and directly. You have the chance to experience the brightness of life and the haziness of life, which is also a source of power. The fantastically sharp-edged quality of life can be experienced personally and directly. There is a powerful sense of perception available to you.', author: 'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Listening to the teachings—you\'ve already heard hundreds of teachings,<br />But when you haven\'t grasped the meaning of even one teaching,<br />What\'s the point of more listening?<br /><br />Reflecting on the teachings—even though you\'ve listened,<br />If the teachings aren\'t coming to mind when needed,<br />What\'s the point of more reflection? None.<br /><br />Meditating according to the teachings—<br />If your meditation practice still isn\'t curing<br />The obscuring states of mind—forget about it!', author: 'Patrul Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Meditation is not on the level of the object but on that of the subject – you are the business of your meditation.', author: 'Lama Yeshe'},
		{quote: 'We all act as if we had lasting, separate, independent selves that it is our constant pre-occupation to protect and foster. It is an unthinking habit that most of us would normally be most unlikely to question or explain. However, all our suffering is associated with this pre-occupation. All loss and gain, pleasure and pain arise because we identify so closely with this vague feeling of selfness that we have. We are so emotionally involved with and attached to this self that we take it for granted.', author: 'Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Death has become a consumer product. Most of us do not contemplate the nature of death on a deep level. We don\'t acknowledge that our bodies and environment are made up of unstable elements that can fall apart with even the slightest provocation. Of course we know that one day we will die. But most of us, unless we have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, think that we are in the clear for the time being. On the rare occasion that we think about death, we wonder, How much will I inherit? or Where will they scatter my ashes?', author: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Wishing for “happily ever after” is nothing more than a desire for permanence in disguise. Fabricating concepts such as “eternal love,” “everlasting happiness,” and “salvation” generates more evidence of impermanence. Our intention and the result are at odds. We intend to establish ourselves and our world, but we forget that the corrosion begins as soon as creation begins. What we aim for is not decay, but what we do leads directly to decay.', author: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'If you let go a little, you will have a little peace. If you let go a lot, you will have a lot of peace. If you let go completely, you will have complete peace.', author: 'Ajahn Chah'},
		{quote: 'In meditation practice, you might experience a muddy, semiconscious, drifting state, like having a hood over your head: a dreamy dullness. This is really nothing more than a kind of blurred and mindless stagnation. How do you get out of this state? Alert yourself, straighten your back, breathe the stale air out of your lungs, and direct your awareness into clear space to freshen your mind. If you remain in this stagnant state you will not evolve, so whenever this setback arises, clear it again and again. It is important to be as watchful as possible, and to stay as vigilant as you can.', author: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'There\'s a reason you can learn from everything: you have basic wisdom, basic intelligence, and basic goodness.', author: 'Pema Chödrön'},
		{quote: 'Happiness arises as a result of different causes and conditions. If you harm someone out of anger, you may feel some superficial satisfaction, but deep down you know it was wrong. Your confidence will be undermined. However, if you have an altruistic attitude, you\'ll feel comfortable and confident in the presence of others.', author: '14th Dalai Lama'},
		{quote: 'Why is compassion of foremost importance in the Buddha\'s teachings? Because it is the root of all the vastness and profundity of the bodhisattva path. Compassion is the awakened heart itself.', author: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'You think that you can only establish true practice after you attain enlightenment, but it is not so. True practice is established in delusion, in frustration. If you make some mistake, that is where to establish your practice. There is no other place for you to establish your practice.<br /><br />We talk about enlightenment, but in its true sense perfect enlightenment is beyond our understanding, beyond our experience. Even in our imperfect practice enlightenment is there. We just don\'t know it. So the point is to find the true meaning of practice before we attain enlightenment. Wherever you are, enlightenment is there. If you stand up right where you are, that is enlightenment.', author: 'Shunryu Suzuki'},
		{quote: 'Developing compassion is the most fruitful way of “getting even” with people who make you angry.', author: 'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'The sun of real happiness shines in your life when you start to cherish others.', author: 'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'It\'s crucial for us to become good people. If we are not, then how could we say we\'re Buddhist? We need to reflect: What kind of person am I? If you\'re making a golden vase, first you have to see if the material is real gold. If it\'s brass, then you\'re not making a gold vase. To become a good Buddhist, you have to become a good human being. It doesn\'t mean that you have no anger or jealousy, for example, but that you have decreased the negative emotions. Otherwise, it\'s a sham: you have the name of a Buddhist, but have not transformed yourself. Nobody can change us. We have to talk to and instruct ourselves about the right way, then change will happen.', author: '17th Karmapa'},
		{quote: 'Samsara is to see fault in others.', author: 'Tilopa'},
		{quote: 'Be compassionate to yourself, even as you look at your mistakes and mishaps. Then, if others are less than perfect too, use your developing compassion to kill your anger and frustration. Practise this every minute. Life is the practice. As the Buddha said, \'Now, everything is totally in your hands.\'', author: 'Gyalwang Drukpa'},
		{quote: 'The chances of finding a human existence are one in a hundred.<br />Now that you have found one, if you fail to practise the sublime Dharma,<br />How could you possibly expect to find such an opportunity again?<br />This is why it\'s crucial that you take advantage of your situation.', author: 'Chatral Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'The nature of mind has to be recognized by the nature of mind. It is not \'you\' recognizing your nature of mind; it is your nature of mind recognizes your nature of mind. It is so easy therefore it is so difficult. It is there all the time. Our mind recognizes our nature of mind all the time. We are never separate. But somehow, as it is said in the mahamudra prayer, “self awareness, under the power of ignorance, is confused into a \'self\'”. So because of ignorance, the nature of mind that we recognize every moment, every moment we mistake it as \'I\'.', author: 'Tai Situ Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Each of you should feel that you have great potential and that, with self-confidence and a little more effort, change really is possible if you want it. If you feel that your present way of life is unpleasant or has some difficulties, then don\'t look at these negative things. See the positive side, the potential, and make an effort.', author: '14th Dalai Lama'},
		{quote: 'Even when you find yourself in the best of situations, you never feel it is enough. You always want more. You give little thought to others wishes and desires, and only want favorable circumstances for yourself. If you do the slightest favor for someone, you feel you have done something quite extraordinary. That you are so preoccupied with your own happiness and welfare, and neglect the welfare and happiness of others, is the reason you are wandering in samsara.', author: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Getting butter from milk is only possible because milk already contains cream. No one ever made butter by churning water. The prospector looks for gold in rocks and not in wood chips. Likewise, the quest for perfect enlightenment only makes sense because buddha-nature is already present in every being. Without that nature, all efforts would be futile.', author: 'Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thaye'},
		{quote: 'With many distractions one is not able to practice the Dharma properly. Distraction means a lot of business, noise and things to do. When going up in the mountains there will be less distraction. That is the reason for mountain retreat. In addition to that, if one is able to keep some discipline, remaining in solitude without allowing outsiders to visit and not going out oneself, there will be no other distraction than that made by one\'s own mind. External distractions have been eliminated. That is the purpose of seclusion.', author: 'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Concentration is a gathering together of all the positive forces of the mind and tightly focusing them into an intense beam. Mastering concentration means learning to aim that beam and keep it directed where we want it. This kind of concentration is strong and energetic, yet gentle, and it does not wander away. Building concentration is primarily a matter of removing certain mental factors that hinder its application. We then learn to point the beam at the right things, the really fruitful things within the mind. When we study these things carefully, they cease to bind us and we become free. Concentration, along with awareness, allows the mind to look at itself, to examine its own workings, to find and dissolve the things that impede its natural flow.', author: 'Bhante Gunaratana'},
		{quote: 'The Buddha told his disciple Ananda to see impermanence, to see death with every breath. We must know death; we must die in order to live. What does that mean? To die is to come to the end of our doubts, all our questions, and just be here with the present reality. You can never die tomorrow; you must die now. Can you do it? If you can do it, you will know the peace of no more questions.', author: 'Ajahn Chah'},
		{quote: 'Our difficulty is we don\'t see things as they really are. Dharma helps us to understand how to see things as they actually are. When we do this, it stops our negative mind, negative projections, and negative emotions. Then our life becomes simpler and more peaceful, and it also gives us a great opportunity to take more responsibility, with more compassion, and we can handle problems in a much more positive way. Problems then don\'t become real problems. We become more accepting and understanding of what is happening around us, whether it concerns business or relatives. There is no separation; there are not two worlds, of business and private life.', author: 'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Rest in natural great peace this exhausted mind,<br />Beaten helpless by karma and neurotic thoughts<br />Like the relentless fury of the pounding waves<br />In the infinite ocean of samsara.<br />Rest in natural great peace.', author: 'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Samsara and enlightenment\'s pervasive evenness is the view;<br />Within it, meditation is uncontrived settling in the natural state.<br />Conduct is to relax in non-activity.<br />Accept these as the keys of view, meditation, and conduct.', author: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'The essence of retreat is setting up a boundary – and we are not actually talking about a physical boundary, but we are talking about a boundary of time, setting up a boundary between past and future, which ideally means we remain in presentness.', author: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'A zen master\'s life is one continuous mistake.', author: 'Dogen Zenji'},
		{quote: 'To uproot grasping at self, we need to realize wisdom. To realize wisdom, we need merit. Merit releases us from negative emotions, the cause of samsaric suffering, and loosens our grasping at self. As that happens, we glimpse the true nature of our mind. Once we do, we can meditate on the true nature to perfect the realization of wisdom. Until then, we need to make merit.', author: 'Tulku Thondup Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'The Buddhist notion of diligence is to delight in positive deeds.', author: 'Ringu Tulku Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Behold now, Bhikkhus, I exhort you: All compounded things are subject to decay. Strive with diligence!', author: 'Buddha'},
		{quote: 'Give up attachment to this life and let your mind become Dharma!', author: 'Dromtönpa'},
		{quote: 'In brief, taking your own mind as witness, make your life and practice one, and at the time of death, with no thought of anything left undone, do not be ashamed of yourself. This itself is the pith instruction of all practices.', author: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'We work on ourselves in order to help others, but also we help others in order to work on ourselves.', author: 'Pema Chödrön'},
		{quote: 'Wherever you go you will find your teacher, as long as you have the eyes to see and the ears to hear.', author: 'Shunryu Suzuki'},
		{quote: 'If we always turn our mind to virtue, we always experience happiness as a result.', author: 'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Our birth and death are just one thing. You can\'t have one without the other. It\'s a little funny to see how at a death people are so tearful and sad, and at a birth how happy and delighted. It\'s delusion. I think that if you really want to cry, then it would be better to do so when someone\'s born. Cry at the root, for if there were no birth, there would be no death. Can you understand this?', author: 'Ajahn Chah'},
		{quote: 'I have noticed that some people are uncomfortable when they are told that change is a fundamental part of life, or that nothing lasts forever. Yet impermanence is just a basic fact of our existence—it is neither good nor bad in itself. When we face impermanence wisely, we have an opportunity to cultivate a more constructive way of relating to that reality. If we do so, we can actually learn to feel at ease in the face of unexpected change, and work comfortably with whatever new situations might occur.', author: '17th Karmapa'},
		{quote: 'My path is the path of stopping, the path of enjoying the present moment. It is a path where every step brings me back to my true home. It is a path that leads nowhere. I am on my way home. I arrive at every step.', author: 'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
		{quote: 'You will fall sick, experience pain, and encounter many adverse circumstances. At such times do not think, ‘Although I am practicing the Dharma, I have nothing but trouble. The Dharma cannot be so great. I have followed a teacher and done so much practice, and yet hard times still befall me.\' Such thoughts are wrong views. You should realize that through the blessing and power of the practice, by experiencing sickness and other difficulties now, you are purifying and ridding yourself of negative actions…. By purifying them while you have the chance, you will later go from bliss to bliss. So do not think, ‘I don\'t deserve this illness, these obstacles, these negative influences.\' Experience your difficulties as blessings…when you do experience such difficulties, you should be very happy and avoid having adverse thoughts like, ‘Why are such terrible things happening to me?\'', author: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'Some do not understand<br />that we must die,<br />But those who do realize this<br />settle their quarrels.', author: 'Buddha'},
		{quote: 'If we believe that mind is continuous, our love for others becomes continuous. If we recognize this continuity, we do not trust temporary, tangible circumstances or take them too seriously. Since it is tiring to switch between changing uncertainties, which are inherently impermanent and unimportant, we become less easily influenced by any circumstance. This creates the habit of stability so that our minds are less erratic, our lives are less chaotic, and our feelings for others are less changeable, which causes love to become increasingly deep and loyal.', author: 'Thinley Norbu Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'The location of the truth of the Great Perfection is the unfabricated mind of the present moment, this naked radiant awareness itself, not a hair of which has been forced into relaxation. Maintaining this at all times, just through not forgetting it even in the states of eating, sleeping, walking, and sitting, is called meditation. However, until you are free from the obscurations of cognition, it is impossible for this not to be mixed with the experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptualization. Nevertheless, just by not forgetting the nature of one\'s own awareness — the kind that is not a tangled mindfulness that gets more tangled in order to be mindful — at some point the unelaborated ultimate truth, transcending terms and examples, will appear.', author: 'Jigme Lingpa'},
		{quote: 'For generosity, nothing to do,<br />Other than stop fixating on self.<br /><br />For morality, nothing to do,<br />Other than stop being dishonest.<br /><br />For patience, nothing to do,<br />Other than not fear what is ultimately true.<br /><br />For effort, nothing to do,<br />Other than practice continuously.<br /><br />For meditative stability, nothing to do,<br />Other than rest in presence.<br /><br />For wisdom, nothing to do,<br />Other than know directly how things are.', author: 'Milarepa'},
		{quote: 'Once you know what has to be taken up and what has to be avoided, you must avoid even the minutest negative action. If you find you have committed a negative action physically, verbally, or mentally, you must acknowledge it immediately, confess, and repair the downfall. And if you see that you have done something positive, make a prayer ‘May I do even more, may I increase in virtue\'.', author: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'To give your sheep or cow a large spacious meadow is the way to control him.', author: 'Shunryu Suzuki'},
		{quote: 'Apply yourself to solitude. One who is given to solitude knows things as they really are.', author: 'Buddha'},
		{quote: 'Even though the meditator may leave the meditation, the meditation will not leave the meditator.', author: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
		{quote: 'If we can allow some space within our awareness and rest there, we can respect our troubling thoughts and emotions, allow them to come, and let them go. Our lives may be complicated on the outside, but we remain simple, easy, and open on the inside.', author: 'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
