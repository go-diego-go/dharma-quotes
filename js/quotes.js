    {q:'Now we are at a crossroads. We have had the good fortune to be born a human being in a world where a Buddha has come and has taught the Dharma; we have met a spiritual teacher who can transmit the Dharma to us, and we have received his instructions; and we are physically and mentally capable of putting his instructions into practice. So now it is up to us to decide: Are we going to climb up the path of liberation with the determination to bring all beings to the supreme level of enlightenment? Or will we descend even deeper into the labyrinth of samsara, from which it is so difficult to escape?',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Sometimes we do suffer intensely, when we are sick and so on. When we are sick we should resort to medicines and when we get into trouble with people we should try to get out of that trouble. Definitely. However, our attitude to the suffering and the trouble should not be one that defines them as solely negative. Suffering is like a broom that sweeps away the causes of suffering and when we understand this then the suffering is reduced to its true stature. Without the understanding it tends to become amplified to twice, ten or a hundred times its true size. The way we develop our understanding is to think, "The suffering that I am now experiencing is the result of previous karmic causes. Just as I do not want to suffer, neither does any being.

    {q:'How often we get jealous when someone receives a better or a higher teaching than we do? Their getting enlightenment means your wish is at last coming true. With their receiving higher teachings, or someone becoming better practitioners, this means at last your aspiration is being realized!

    {q:'The seven branches serve as antidotes: prostration is the antidote to pride; offering is the antidote to attachment, greed, meanness, and poverty; confession is the antidote to aggression and anger; rejoicing is the antidote to envy and jealousy; requesting the turning of the Wheel of Dharma is the antidote to ignorance; requesting the buddhas and teachers to remain is an antidote to wrong views; and dedication is an antidote to uncertainty and doubts.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'If water flows into a lake and cannot flow out, then it will certainly become stagnant. In other words, once you eat, you must release it in order to live. All possessions are like this. Think of all property as flowing water. Although it is in front of you right now, before long, it will flow away. And it must flow, so let it flow. Do not try to block the flowing. Possessions are also endlessly flowing according to the principle of the universe, which never stops for even a moment. After flowing out, new things flow in. If water doesn\'t flow, then it will become stagnant and give off a bad smell, and will eventually dry up. Mind is also like this.

    {q:'The most important thing is practice in daily life; then you can know gradually the true value of religion. Doctrine is not meant for mere knowledge, but for the improvement of our minds.

    {q:'One can be deceived by three types of laziness:<br/>of indolence, which is the wish to procrastinate;<br/>the laziness of inferiority, which is doubting your capabilities;<br/>and the laziness that is attachment to negative actions, or putting great effort into non-virtue.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Within our beings, all of us, there are these uncontrived, natural roots of virtue, these instinctive seeds of innate goodness.

    {q:'Our notions about happiness entrap us. We forget that they are just ideas. Our idea of happiness can prevent us from actually being happy. We fail to see the opportunity for joy that is right in front of us when we are caught in a belief that happiness should take a particular form.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'Mistakenly believe that dharma practice will make one feel peaceful, and living with a carefree life, this is a great misunderstanding. Buddhism is not a treatment; instead, dharma in fact is specifically designed to flip your life. Therefore, when your life is thwarted at every turn, why complain about this? If you practice, and life has not capsized, then this is a sign that everything you did in practice is not effective yet.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'I feel that happiness is really found in appreciation and rejoicing. Everything is a display of clarity, love, and wisdom.

    {q:'It is impossible to have complete control over the world. Control your mind instead.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'All these experiences of pleasure and pain, are not brought about by anyone but yourself. They are produced by your own actions, good and bad.

    {q:'I will repeat that mindfulness, in other words ‘awareness,’ is our practice. We are ignorant beings, and as such require constant reminders about the importance of making the effort to land in this awareness.

    {q:'Like a child at the cinema, we get caught up in the illusion. From this comes all of our vanity, ambition, and insecurity.

It’s like wearing a mask and proudly thinking that the mask is really you.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Look directly at the mind that doesn\'t want to practice meditation... Does it make you or others happy? Just observe your mind when you don\'t practice, completely without judgement.

All of us want to be happy, but without reflecting or practicing meditation, all of the time we choose the path of suffering.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},

    {q:'It is crucial that practitioners not simply adopt an intellectual approach to the dharma, but rather understand the immense importance of engaging in actions of merit and virtue. Each practitioner is encouraged to examine whether there is a meeting of the view of the dharma in one’s daily conduct and activities.',a:'Mindrolling Trichen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Just as you would try to protect the flame of a lamp by covering it with your hands - you want to protect the mind that sustains a state of equanimity, silence, and simplicity.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you get up, instead of rushing to get ready for work, you can think about how you want to live your day. Taking a few moments to clarify your aspirations or intentions for the day helps you stay open to whatever is happening and helps you remember that this is a brand-new day, a new beginning, and that you can choose to live the day with mindfulness and compassion.',a:'Thich Nhah Hanh'},
    {q:'Don’t burden others with your expectations. Understanding their limitations can inspire compassion instead of disappointment, ensuring beneficial and workable relationships. Remember that you have only a short time together. Be grateful for each day you share.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Whatever occurs — is part of the learning process. So there is nothing to blame; everything is the path, everything is Dharma.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'By understanding emptiness, you lose interest in all the trappings and beliefs that society builds up and tears down - political systems, science and technology, global economy, free society, the United Nations. You become like an adult who is not so interested in childrens games.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The more you are preoccupied by your own physical aging, the more anxious you will become. Do not worry so much about your physical appearance. Concentrate, rather, on not wasting your life. Practise the Dharma. The more you engage in it, the more your satisfaction will grow.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We can let the circumstances of our lives harden us so that we become increasingly resentful and afraid, or we can let them soften us, and make us kinder. You always have the choice.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Dzogchen does not point to anything.',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Whenever you meditate, bear in mind the phrase, \'without distraction and without grasping\', and put this into practice.',a:'Lerab Lingpa'},
    {q:'Practice with joy and enthusiasm, and never fall into laziness or apathy. Especially, never think, "now that is enough." People start to feel proud of themselves after offering a few thousand prostrations and reciting a few hundred thousand mantras, while at the same time feeling not the slightest hesitation to kill insects, indulge all their whims, and make light of their negative acts, numerous though these may be. That is a big mistake. And that is why we need the guidance of a spiritual teacher just as much as a young child needs the guidance of its parents.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Whether we and our fellow beings experience happiness or suffering, whether we have peace or violence in the world, depends entirely on the condition of our minds. The mind is what determines whether there will be happiness or suffering; our states of mind are what makes our actions negative or positive.',a:'Trulshik Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Your Buddha nature is beyond the differences of culture and gender. It does not matter where you come from. It does not matter whether you are a woman or a man. You must always understand this. You must have confidence in the fact that in this life that you have now, you can become a great practitioner.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The problem is, we don’t like the obvious samsaric pain, but we do like the samsaric glory. This samsaric glory, samsaric gain, samsaric beauty which is like time bomb, which will explode sooner or later. That is what we need to really concentrate and put the lower value, or no value at all. Basically it is easier for us to see no value in pain and anxiety. Much more difficult to see no value in samsaric glory.<Paste>',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'How does one break through doubt and hesitation? Apply the skillful means of hearing, reflecting, contemplating, and meditating on the Dharma, then putting the Dharma into practice in your daily life. These are the means for working with doubt and hesitation. In this way you will come to understand the truth of what has been taught or meditated upon from your own experience - and certainty will become your own. When certainty becomes your own, Buddhism is seen as just a method, or means, for realizing what is fundamentally and naturally your intrinsic nature.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The literal meaning of guru yoga is \'union with the teacher´s nature\'. To blend your mind with the teacher\'s mind is the most profound of all practices, and the shortest path of realization. It is the life force of the path and the one practice that includes all others. It was through relying on a spiritual teacher that all the bodhisattvas of the past generated the mind of enlightment and reached perfection.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You might remain sealed in strict retreat for months or even years,<br/>But if you fail to make any progress in the state of your mind,<br/>Later, when you tell everyone about all that you did over such a long time,<br/>Aren\'t you just bragging about all the hardships and deprivation?',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Whatever obstacles we experience, if we can take them the right way, they won\'t obstruct our spiritual path. Rather, they will become a tool to stimulate our advancement toward our destination: unconditional love and enlightenment. So try to feel joy when facing difficulties, for they provide the chance to purify unvirtuous past deeds, the cause of ills, and infuse us with the inspiration to generate yet greater virtuous deeds, the cause of healing and enlightenment.',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'Once you understand that real Dharma practice is not just about formal sitting meditation, but a never-ending confrontation with and opposition to pride and ego, as well as a lesson in how to accept change, you will be able to start practicing right away.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Be kind to the afflicted,<br/>Be gentle with the fool,<br/>Empathize with the weak and oppressed,<br/>Be especially compassionate to those who cling to concrete reality.',a:'Patrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Child, if you speak beautifully but behave badly, you become the worst of practitioners.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'If you accept that death is part of life, then when it actually does come, you may face it more easily.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Enlightenment is intimacy with all things.',a:'Dogen Zenji'},
    {q:'"A great yogi" simply means being free from attachment and clinging.',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If one cannot cultivate bodhicitta within one’s mind, the path to enlightenment is already broken.',a:'Penor Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Devotion is of course the most efficient and most powerful way of accumulating merit.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Maybe we also think that some day we will have gained perfect maturity from the lessons of our lives. We expect to be wise old sages like Yoda, not realizing that maturity is just another aspect of decay.<br/><br/>Subconsciously we are lured by the expectation that we will reach a stage where we don’t have to fix anything ever again. One day we will reach “happily ever after.” We are convinced of the notion of “resolution.” It’s as if everything that we’ve experienced up until now, our whole lives to this moment, was a dress rehearsal.<br/><br/>We believe our grand performance is yet to come, so we do not live for today.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Think of all those around the world who are dying in hospitals right now. Then imagine that you yourself are on your deathbed. You are about to lose all you have gathered through a lifetime of effort. You can\'t take any of it with you. Your friends and family surround you, but no matter how much you love or are attached to them, in a few moments you will never see them again. Imagine your terror. Then let your mind rest.<br/><br/>Next, bring your attention back to the present circumstances. You are not dying in this moment or losing those you love. You are not starving or about to be killed. Appreciate your good fortune. Again, let the mind rest.<br/><br/>Then resolve to do what you can to reduce the suffering of others. Let the mind rest. Pray that you will accomplish this, and again let the mind rest<br/><br/>Repeat this process as you imagine different circumstances in which others are suffering.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Live with compassion<br/>Work with compassion<br/>Die with compassion<br/>Meditate with compassion<br/>Enjoy with compassion<br/>When problems come,<br/>Experience them with compassion.',a:'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'How many chances do we need, how much more of samsara do we need to roam around before we figure out that it may be crucial to have a spiritual guide?',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'We don’t need faith before we come. The Buddha didn’t demand that. He never said, you have to faith in me first and then I’ll teach you.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'If Guru Yoga is practiced authentically a steady flow of inspiration from our guru will fill our mind stream providing the foundation for insight and realization.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'The common enemy of all religious disciplines is selfishness of mind. For it is just this which causes ignorance, anger, and passion, which are at the root of all troubles of the world.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'In the beginning of Buddhist practice, our ability to serve others is limited. The emphasis is on healing ourselves, transforming our minds and hearts. But as we continue, we become stronger and increasingly able to serve others.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Even when we are helping others and are engaged in charity work, we should not regard ourselves in a very haughty way as great protectors benefitting the weak.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Get out of the construction business. Stop building bridges across the raging waters of samsaric existence, attempting to reach the \'far shore,\' nirvana. Better to simply relax, at ease and carefree, in total naturalness, and just go with the primordial flow, however it occurs and happens. And remember this: whether or not you go with the flow, it always goes with you.',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Renounce negative friendships,<br/>And rely on a spiritual friend.<br/>Discard hostile and unhappy mental states,<br/>And venture forth to where happiness lies.',a:'Atisha'},
    {q:'When a thought comes it brings with it another and then another in an endless succession. We must break the chain of thoughts by letting them dissolve by themselves. It is this chain that has deceived us from beginningless time. If we do not break it now, it will continue to deceive us forever.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When I practice remaining in mind’s true condition,<br/>I am without stability,<br/>Yet I mouth off about the profound view,<br/>And toss cause and effect to the winds.<br/>On the outside - I can give a show of good behavior;<br/>On the inside - desire, attachment, greed rage like fire.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Child, if you are not hypocritical and out of control, that is conduct.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'Just as without drinking water, thirst could not be quenched, without practicing, liberation could not be obtained through genuine Dharma.',a:'Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The stronger our devotion, the greater the blessings. But to have no devotion is like hiding oneself in a house with all the doors and shutters closed. The sunlight will never get in.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The buddha is within; all the qualities of enlightenment are present within our own nature. This is the principal point in which we must exert ourselves, in which we must train.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If one investigates to find the supreme method,<br/>For accomplishing the aims of oneself and others,<br/>It comes down to bodhicitta alone.<br/>Being certain of this, develop it with joy.',a:'Khunu Lama Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is not enough to wish from time to time that you could be free of samsara. That idea must pervade your stream of thinking, day and night. A prisoner locked in jail thinks all the time about different ways of getting free—how he might climb over the walls, ask powerful people to intervene, or raise money to bribe someone. So, too, seeing the suffering and imperfection of samsara, never stop thinking about how to gain liberation, with a deep feeling of renunciation.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Profound and tranquil, free from complexity, uncompounded luminous clarity, beyond the mind of conceptual ideas; this is the depth of the mind of the Victorious Ones. In this there is not a thing to be removed, nor anything that needs to be added. It is merely the immaculate looking naturally at itself.',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'All the qualities of your natural mind – peace, openness, relaxation, and clarity – are present in your mind just as it is. You don’t have to do anything different. You don’t have to shift or change your awareness. All you have to do while observing your mind is to recognize the qualities it already has.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A mature practitioner will usually have a far purer perception of others than a beginner. The more enlightened qualities a practitioner acquires, the humbler he will become; the more time he spends with his guru, the greater his devotion; and the more he hears and contemplates the dharma, the quicker his pride and arrogance will diminish.<br/><br/>The supreme sign of a great practitioner is not that he sprouts a halo, has extraordinarily auspicious dreams, experiences bliss continuously, or can foresee our miserable futures.<br/<br/>The supreme sign is that he no longer has any interest in material gain, fame, the respect of others, or being the centre of attention.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Even though thoughts and emotions come and go, the mind’s natural clarity is never disturbed or interrupted.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Even if through being generous in the past, I am rich in this life,<br/>If I give nothing in this life, I\'ll be poor in the next.',a:'Mipham Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Most people, thinking of the future, make a lot of plans — but the future they plan for is only the very few years of this life. This is very shortsighted; we have such a long way to go in lives to come. Death is just the threshold, which we have to cross alone, aided only by our faith in the teacher and the Three Jewels and by our confidence in the practice. Relatives, friends, power, wealth, and whatever else we have become so used to relying on will simply no longer be there.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Look at the real nature of the harm that is done to you. It is as elusive as a drawing on water. Let your resentment subside by itself. When the stormy waves of thoughts have vanished, the mind becomes like the cloudless sky that has nothing to win or lose.',a:'Shechen Gyaltsab'},
    {q:'We live in illusion and the appearance of things. There is a reality. We are that reality. When you understand this, you see that you are nothing, and being nothing, you are everything. That is all.',a:'Kalu Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The more and more you listen, the more and more you hear; the more and more you hear, the deeper and deeper your understanding becomes.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If possible, make others happy more than oneself. If not, make them equally happy. At least, don\'t make others unhappy.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche´'},
    {q:'There is no miserable place waiting for you, no hell realm, sitting and waiting like Alaska - waiting to turn you into ice cream. But whatever you call it - hell or the suffering realms - it is something that you enter by creating a world of neurotic fantasy and believing it to be real. It sounds simple, but that\'s exactly what happens.',a:'Lama Yeshe'},
    {q:'The way to accomplish happiness in the world is to do meaningful work in one’s own life with a positive motivation that sees all people and all traditions as equal.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'For anyone, man or woman, who has faith in me,<br/>I, the Lotus Born, have never departed.<br/>I sleep on their threshold.',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you waste your life now on endless minor tasks, you can be sure that at the time of death you will weep with regret and be stricken with intense anxiety, like a thief who has just been thrown into jail and anxiously anticipates his punishment. A person might find himself with nothing to eat, no clothes to wear, and no house to live in; but if his mind is filled with faith in his teacher and the Three Jewels, that person will both live and die with his heart always joyful and confident.<br/><br/>It is not enough to wish from time to time that you could be free of samsara. That idea must pervade your stream of thinking, day and night. A prisoner locked in jail thinks all the time about different ways of getting free—how he might climb over the walls, ask powerful people to intervene, or raise money to bribe someone. So, too, seeing the suffering and imperfection of samsara, never stop thinking about how to gain liberation, with a deep feeling of renunciation.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'Although hundreds or thousands of explanations are given,<br/>There is only one thing to be understood -<br/>Know the one thing that liberates everything -<br/>Awareness itself, your true nature.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Worldly goals are endless and have no true value. But to practice with the idea of gaining enlightenment solely in order to benefit others is to aspire to the most noble and worthwhile goal of all.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Within our perceived weaknesses and imperfections lies the key to realizing our true strength.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Many modern students follow teachers around and accumulate empowerments and transmissions and take many teachings. But this is not a substitute for practice. Pure students don’t hang around the teachers that much. They come for instruction, or guidance, or clarification, and then they go off and practice.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'As long as there is an ego, there are demons.<br/>When there is no more ego, there are no more demons either.',a:'Machig Labdrön'},
    {q:'It is difficult to learn the names of the vows, let alone observe them. So at least you should strive to be loving to people, especially those who are close to you such as friends, relatives, Dharma brothers and sisters, and neighbours. Try to avoid harming them. Be respectful to them, as all are enlightened in their true nature. Then, in a simple way, you are moving towards fulfilling the pratimoksha vow of not harming others, the bodhisattvas\' vow of being loving to others, and the tantric vow of pure perception.',a:'Dodrupchen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Although we are responsible for what we sow, we forget that we\'ve planted these seeds and either give credit to or blame people or things outside of us when they ripen… In the moment, we have a thought, we speak or act. But we lose sight of the fact that each thought, word, and action will produce a result. When the fruit finally ripens, we think, “Why did this happen to me? I\'ve done nothing to deserve this."',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It\'s vital always to bear in mind that we practice for the sake of all other beings, and that the enormity of this aspiration is what makes Dharma practice both extremely powerful and inexhaustible, virtually guaranteeing that the result will be infinitely beneficial.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Ordinary people do not question the commonly accepted version of reality. They conform to the standard values of subduing enemies and cherishing friends and family. Materialism, ambition and mundane achievements are the worldly hallmarks of success. We experience the phenomenal world and our minds as solid and truly existent. Very few people doubt these assertions and question their validity. Yet, the process of disbelief is the first step on the spiritual path.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Always take the lowest place. Help other beings as much as you can. In everything you do, simply work at developing love and compassion until they have become a fundamental part of you.',a:'Patrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is our mind, and that alone, that chains us or sets us free.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Never forget how swiftly this life will be over, like a flash of summer lightning or the wave of a hand. Now that you have the opportunity to practice dharma, do not waste a single moment on anything else.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We must remember<br/>that our negative emotions,<br/>like our greed and our jealousy and so forth,<br/>all of these are not part of our true nature.<br/>Therefore, they can be purified.<br/>Therefore, we can change.',a:'Jetsünma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'As an old parchment that curls around itself,<br/>Negative tendencies tend to come back. <br/>New habits are easily destroyed by circumstances.<br/>You will not cut through delusion in an instant.<br/>All you who you consider yourselves great meditators, <br/>Spend more time in meditation!',a:'Gyalwa Yangönpa'},
    {q:'If you don\'t reflect on death and impermanence,<br/>There\'ll be no way to practice Dharma purely.<br/>Practice will remain an aspiration,<br/>One that is constantly postponed.<br/>And you may feel regret the day that death comes,<br/>But by then it\'s too late!',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Buddhahood can not be attained elsewhere.<br/>If this goal is sought outside oneself,<br/>Even the efforts of countless eons<br/>Will fail to bear any fruit.<br/>Search not, strive not.<br/>Let your mind rest in its natural state.',a:'Machig Labdrön'},
    {q:'If your mind is pure,<br/>Everyone is a Buddha.<br/>If your mind is impure, <br/>Everyone is ordinary.',a:'Trulshik Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Having nothing to rely upon, we have no choice but to feel upset.<br/>Having misplaced our trust, we have no choice but to feel compassion.<br/>Having found the truly trustworthy, we have no choice but to feel joy.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Some people spend all their energy, and even risk their lives to achieve fame. Fame and notoriety are both no more than an empty echo. Your reputation is an alluring mirage that can easily lead you astray. Discard it without a second thought, like the snot you blow from your nose.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Until you are ready to give your life and body for the sake of others in reality, which is not the case at present, you can at least do it mentally. As your mind grows used to altruistic love and compassion, your words and actions will naturally reflect that attitude.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Joy is extremely important within the context of these immeasurable contemplations because even though we make a wish that everyone be completely happy, we still tend to feel jealous of those who appear better off than we are.<br/><br/>Jealousy and envy are what I call “loser” emotions, and the antidote to them both is to arouse a sense of appreciative joy.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In brief, the practice of Dharma is to sever all that ties to samsara, to cultivate gentle love and compassion for all beings of the six realms, and at all times, without distraction, to thoroughly master your own mind.',a:'Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö'},
    {q:'The essence of the highest teachings lies within a simple moment of awareness.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'At the beginning nothing comes, in the middle nothing stays, in the end nothing goes.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'As in the sky all clouds disappear into sky itself: Wherever they go, they go nowhere, wherever they are, they are nowhere. This is the same for thoughts in the mind: When mind looks at mind, the waves of conceptual thought disappear.',a:'Machig Labdrön'},
    {q:'We should regard everyone being equal and treat them wholeheartedly with compassion, no matter if they are high, middle, or low in their social status.',a:'Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Once you overcome the hatred within your mind, you will discover that in the world outside, there is no longer any such thing as even a single enemy.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Remaining in the practice where the world and beyond arise as ornaments,<br/>I sustained the fundamental nature, free from fixating on hope and fear.',a:'Sera Khandro'},
    {q:'Time is very precious. Do not wait until you are dying to understand your spiritual nature. If you do it now, you will discover resources of kindness and compassion that you didn’t know you had.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we do not like to experience any pain or suffering of any kind, how can we expect any other creature whether big or small to feel otherwise?',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Child, if grasping obscures your view, don’t be timid about cutting it away.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'The fleeting pleasures of this world are like the canopies of clouds that appear one moment in the sky and are gone the next. People immerse themselves in these enjoyments, claiming that they are necessary for their livelihood and indispensable for their survival. And yet the life of humankind is no more than a flash of lightning',a:'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When truth and the courage to walk on the path of truth are joined with mindfulness, a practitioner truly begins to practice the dharma.',a:'Mindrolling Trichen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is said that the difference between buddhas and sentient beings is like the difference between the narrowness and the openness of space. Sentient beings are like the space held within a tightly closed fist, while buddhas are fully open, all-encompassing.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Spending your time with true spiritual friends will fill you with love for all beings and help you to see how negative attachment and hatred are. Being with such friends, and following their example, will naturally imbue you with their good qualities, just as all the birds flying around a golden mountain are bathed in its golden radiance.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Those who become Buddhas put others before themselves. Doing so is the secret to their success on the path to enlightenment. Their determination to be of benefit to others allows them to accomplish two goals: they help others, and at the same time, without trying, they achieve their own temporary and ultimate happiness.',a:'Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche'},
    {q:'This primordial ground is present in the mindstreams of all sentient beings, but it is tightly constricted by dualistic grasping; and it is regarded as external, firm, and solid. This is like water in its natural, fluid state freezing in a cold wind. It is due to dualistic grasping onto subjects and objects that the ground, which is naturally free, becomes frozen into the appearances of things.',a:'Dudjom Lingpa'},
    {q:'Honestly, there is only one solution: set your buttocks down on the meditation cushion and train in how to be free. As far as I am concerned, that is the only way.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You may possess the power and force of a world ruler, but unless you gain mastery over your mind, when the time of death arrives, you still haven\'t attained the power of freedom.',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'So we had better think again and use our common sense. If we let our mind mistreat us so that we spend our lives suffering and making others suffer around us, that\'s a sign of a lack of common sense. The thoughts and words that come from a disturbed state of mind can be considered ‟negative.” Instead of complaining about our fate, if we cultivate altruism and compassion, so that those ‟positive” states of mind improve our well-being and that of others, that shows that we do have common sense.',a:'Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Understand that kind actions create happiness for self and other.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You cannot sit here in the shrine room serenely practicing and then walk out that door and treat each other badly...<br/>If you meditate in perfect peace and then flash someone an irritable look because they make noise or their child cries, you are entirely missing the point.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Accustomed long to contemplating love and compassion,<br/>I have forgotten all difference between myself and others.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'You don\'t lose anything by sharing. Strength grows by giving it away.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We should learn to see everyday life as mandala – the luminous fringes of experience, which radiate spontaneously from the empty nature of our being. The aspects of our mandala are the day-to-day objects of our life experience moving in the dance or play of the universe. By this symbolism the inner teacher reveals the profound and ultimate significance of being.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Dharma practice becomes very important when you know through experience that your mind can be your greatest friend or your greatest enemy.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is always beneficial to be near a spiritual teacher. These masters are like gardens or medicinal plants, sanctuaries of wisdom. In the presence of a realized master, you will rapidly attain enlightenment. In the presence of an erudite scholar, you will acquire great knowledge. In the presence of a great meditator, spiritual experience will dawn in your mind. In the presence of a bodhisattva, your compassion will expand, just as an ordinary log placed next to a log of sandalwood becomes saturated, little by little, with its fragrance.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you feel attachment towards something that you believe to be attractive, or aversion towards something that you believe to be repulsive, understand that to be your mind\'s obscuration, nothing but a magical illusion.',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'To feel responsible for our loved ones is commendable, but we have the ability to open our mind and accept the responsibility for infinite beings. Why limit our deep sense of tenderness to a few people, when we can extend it to all beings?',a:'Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When the wind blows the clouds disappear, and all of space is filled with the light of the sun. So too, through the power of dharma practice, our obscurations will disappear, revealing what has been there since beginningless time - buddha nature and all of its qualities.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you were to gather all the glory, enjoyment, pleasure and happiness of the world and put it all together, it would not approach one tiny fraction of the bliss that you experience upon realizing the nature of mind.',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The root of all phenomena is your mind. If unexamined, it rushes after experiences, ingenious in the games of deception. If you look right into it, it is free of any ground or origin. In essence it is free of any coming, staying or going.',a:'Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö'},
    {q:'If anyone superior or inferior comes to hinder your practice, you should be unshakable, like an iron boulder pulled by a silk scarf. It won\'t do to be a weak character whose head bends in whichever direction the wind blows, like grass on a mountain pass.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Child, death is inevitable,<br/>Do not be afraid.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'It is not when things go well that you can judge a true practitioner. When adverse circumstances arise, you can clearly see shortcomings in their practice.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Tomorrow or your next existence,<br/>Who knows which will come first?',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We feel nurtured when we are nurturing. Only a nurturing person can nurture, and a nurturing person is nurtured by his or her own caring attitudes. If you can develop these qualities, you will no longer have to go around like a sponge, soaking up the drops of love others leave behind.',a:'Traleg Kyabgön Rinpoche'},
    {q:'My practice is devotion to the buddhist path; others may choose doubting the buddhist path. But as Dharmakirti said, ultimately we must abandon the path. So I hope in the end we will meet where we have nothing to fight over.',a:'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Worldly preoccupations never end until the moment we die. But they end when we drop them. Such is their nature.',a:'Longchenpa'},
    {q:'Wise people realize that all happiness and suffering depend upon the mind, and so they seek happiness from the mind itself. They do not rely on external sources, as they understand that the causes of happiness are complete within themselves. If we realize this, then whether we face problems caused by other beings or material things, they won\'t be able to hurt us much at all.',a:'Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima'},
    {q:'As long a we take some time every day to settle our mind and reflect on the pitfalls of self-importance and the benefits of altruism, we don\'t need much more of a lojong practice than what\'s already going on in our lives. How many times a day do we interact with people, at the workplace, in our family, in our social life? If we have the motivation to step out of our small self, each interaction can be a practice of altruism. We can simply smile, listen, help others feel relaxed, soothed. There is not just one method. We can creatively turn everything into bodhisattva activity.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Why would you invest all that energy on those plans for the future if you were not somehow blindly convinced that you are still sure to be here in this world for a long time to come?<br/>The great practitioners of the past described themselves as “yogis with the thought of impermanence implanted firmly in their hearts.” They saw clearly the futility of ordinary pursuits. Their minds were entirely turned toward the Dharma.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We need to be born a human being, as this is the only state of existence in which there is enough suffering to give us an acute desire to be free from samsara, yet not so much suffering that we no longer have the opportunity to free ourselves through the practice of Dharma. If we do not make use of the precious opportunity of a human existence, we cannot but go downward, like a stone rolling down a hill.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is crucial that practitioners not simply adopt an intellectual approach to the dharma, but rather understand the immense importance of engaging in actions of merit and virtue. Each practitioner is encouraged to examine whether there is a meeting of the view of the dharma in one\'s daily conduct and activities.',a:'Mindrolling Trichen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you study the Dharma, please do so with a willingness to admit, “I do have some faults. They are mine and I am also the one who needs to change them.” Once we face ourselves with this type of sincerity, the door is wide open to genuine progress by quickly taming our own minds.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If the meditator is able to use whatever occurs in his life as the path, his body becomes a retreat hut.',a:'Jigme Lingpa'},
    {q:'If we lack peace of mind, then what good does it do us to have youth, beauty, health, wealth, education, and worldly power?',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'Hey! This is self-knowing primordial wisdom. It is beyond articulation and it is not an experienced object of the mind. It is nothing that can be demonstrated by me, Tilopa. Know it by letting your own self-awareness indicate itself.',a:'Tilopa'},
    {q:'If we think of ourselves as cattle with ropes hanging from our noses, Dharma practitioners hold that rope in their own hands, whereas ordinary people are controlled by others.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We have a lamp inside us. The oil of that lamp is our deep breathing, our gentle steps, and our kind smile. Our practice is to light up the lamp.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'When a rainbow appears vividly in the sky, you can see its beautiful colors, yet you could not wear it as clothing, or put it on as an ornament. It arises through the conjunction of various factors, but there is nothing about it that can be grasped. Likewise, thoughts that arise in the mind have no tangible existence or intrinsic solidity. There is no logical reason why thoughts, which have no substance, should have so much power over you, nor is there any reason why you should become their slave.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you realize that all that appears and exists to be your mind, there is no path of enlightenment apart from that.',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Slandering beings is slandering Buddha Nature; stop doing that. If due to your own impurity you perceive mistakes in other beings, at least do not voice them. If your awareness practice is too weak to sustain pure perception naturally, try to develop a rapport within an intellectual understanding of Buddha Nature in others. Know that your impure perception of others only happens either because you have not recognized genuine awareness, or because that recognition is not developed. Criticizing and slandering others puts you out of tune with the enlightened essence. You mainly harm yourself. The most unrealized so-called practitioner of Dzogchen can at least keep his or her mouth shut, even if he can not actually maintain the view.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The underlying sense of uneasiness that we have now is actually a good thing: it is the expression of our sensitivity. Those who go through life without feeling ill at ease are unconscious. The uneasy feeling caused by our awareness holds tremendous potential for transformation. It is a treasure of energy that we can grasp with both hands and use to build something better. Indifference doesn\'t lead anywhere.',a:'Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'To meet someone who really hurts you, is to meet a rare and precious treasure. Hold that person in high esteem, and make full use of the opportunity to eradicate your defects and make progress on the path. If you cannot yet feel love and compassion for those who treat you badly, it is a sign that your mind has not been fully transformed, and that you need to keep working on it with increased application.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When my time has come and impermanence and death have caught up with me,<br/>When the breath ceases, and the body and mind go their separate ways, <br/>May I not experience delusion, attachment, and clinging,<br/>But remain in the natural state of ultimate reality.',a:'Longchenpa'},
    {q:'Anger, like any other thought or feeling, has no true existence – not even a definitive location in your body, speech, or mind. It is just like wind roaring in empty space.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'I study my mind and therefore all appearances are my texts.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'There is no other way to reach enlightenment than by recognizing Buddha nature and attaining stability in it. Buddhas of the past did that, and the present-day practitioners who will be the Buddhas of the future will do so by recognizing their own nature and attaining stability in it. There is no other way. Nobody else can accomplish enlightenment for us or pull us into liberation. It is completely up to ourselves.',a:'Tulku  Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Don’t boast about your guru: No matter how great you think your guru is, it would probably serve better for you to keep your devotion to yourself. Remember that being buddhist is not joining a cult. If you think your guru is better than another’s, you probably think your equanimity and pure perception are better than another’s.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself.<br/>Perception is not reality. What appear to be faults in others may actually be reflections of our own emotional afflictions. I don\'t have an attitude problem; you have a perception problem.<br/>Remember the way people treat us is their karma. The way we react is our own.',a:'Trulshik Rinpoche'},
    {q:'To put it simply, from the moment you enter the sacred Dharma and become a Dharma practitioner, your inner attitude and outer conduct should far surpass those of an ordinary mundane person. As the saying goes:<br/>"The sign of true learning is a peaceful temperament,<br/>And the sign of having meditated is fewer afflictions."<br/>If, on the contrary, your attitude and conduct are not even slightly better than an average person caught up in worldly affairs, you might consider yourself a scholar simply because you have some intellectual understanding of a few texts. Or you might think you are a perfect monk simply because you maintain celibacy. Or just because you know how to chant a few ritual texts, you might start thinking of yourself as a ngakpa. These are all just instances of blatant arrogance, and only go to show that even with the Dharma one can stumble in the direction of the unwholesome.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we start worrying whether our nose is too big or too small, we should think, “What if I had no head? – now that would be a problem!” As long as we have life, we should rejoice. If everything doesn’t go exactly as we’d like, we can accept it. If we contemplate impermanence deeply, patience and compassion will arise. We will hold less to the apparent truth of our experience, and the mind will become more flexible. Realising that one day this body will be buried or burned, we will rejoice in every moment we have rather than make ourselves or others unhappy.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There are three kinds of Dharma practitioners: Firstly, there are those who look like practitioners outwardly, but inwardly they are not real practitioners. Secondly, there are those who talk very high, but have no realization at all. Thirdly, there are those who do not look like practitioners outwardly, but who are in fact genuine practitioners inside.',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You might ask, ‟If I have Buddha nature, why can\'t I perceive it right now?”<br/>It is because, like gold hidden in its matrix, that nature is hidden by our habits that we have accumulated since beginningless time. These habits have been created by our disturbing emotions and then reinforced by the actions that those disturbances have produced.',a:'Shechen Gyaltsab'},
    {q:'Practising dharma is necessarily a frustrating business. What practitioners, especially beginners, often fail to realise is that frustrations are the signposts of our success. An exasperating lack of concentration, devotion or inspiration might be just what you need to make the extra effort to tune in to your practice fully.<br/>Alternatively, of course, it may topple you in the other direction and stop you practicing altogether—a temptation you must resist at all costs.<br/>Always remember, though, that frustration with your spiritual path is often an indication that you are becoming a genuine dharma practitioner.',a:'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you have truly attained the realization of this emptiness, you will be like the venerable Milarepa or Guru Rinpoche, who were unaffected by the heat of summer or the cold of winter, and who could not be burned by fire or drowned in water. In emptiness there is neither pain nor suffering. We, on the other hand, have not understood the empty nature of the mind and so, when bitten by even a small insect, we think, \'Ouch! I\'ve been bitten. It hurts!\' or, when someone says something unkind, we get angry. That is a sign that we have not realized the mind\'s empty nature.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'I usually describe the essence of Buddhadharma in two sentences: If you can, help others, serve others. If you cannot, at least refrain from harming others.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Genuine compassion is egoless. It is the inherent essence expressed, inseparable from awareness. This natural essence, which is genuine compassion, does not need to be formulated or even expressed as something like “compassion.” We see this exemplified in our great teachers. Their genuine compassion does not require phrases and expressions or even actions. Just their presence, who they are, is nothing other than the quintessence of compassion.<br/>We, in contrast, have to invent and demonstrate compassion. Our contaminated compassion still requires effort and deliberation. That is conventional or general compassion. The good thing about the use of deliberate or conventional compassion is that it matures the mind so that ego-grasping diminishes. It definitely has that effect and is therefore a skillful method for developing awareness compassion.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Do not forget the Lama,<br/>Pray to him at all times.<br/>Do not be carried away by thoughts,<br/>Watch the nature of mind.<br/>Do not forget death,<br/>Persist in Dharma.<br/>Do not forget sentient beings,<br/>With compassion dedicate your merit to them.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Confess your hidden faults.<br/>Approach what you find repulsive.<br/>Help those you think you cannot help.<br/>Anything you are attached to, let it go.<br/>Go to the places that scare you.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'The root of Dharma is your mind.<br/>Tame it and you’re practicing Dharma.<br/>To practice Dharma is to tame your mind,<br/>And when you tame it, then you will be free!',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The most crucial prerequisite for the practice of dharma is complete isolation, because when we are alone we are subject to fewer distractions, creating the perfect conditions for sadness to grow in our minds.<br/>For those who know how to use it, sadness is a fertile ground from which all kinds of beneficial thoughts can spring with very little effort.<br/>Jigme Lingpa described sadness as one of the most invaluable kinds of noble wealth, and in the sutras Buddha hailed sadness as the trailblazer for all subsequent good qualities.',a:'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Although we are responsible for what we sow, we forget that we’ve planted these seeds, and we then either give credit or blame to people or things outside of us when they ripen.<br/>In the moment, we have a thought, we speak, or we act. But we lose sight of the fact that each thought, word, and action will produce a result. When the fruit finally ripens, we think, “Why did this happen to me? I’ve done nothing to deserve this!"',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We should always be realistic at the beginning of the path, and understand that it\'s not going to be a case of experiencing instantaneous results, or that our practice sessions continuously improve day after day. There are going to be ups and downs - our practice might go well today, but tomorrow it might not.<br/>When we come to terms with this fact, and continue to practice each and every day, no matter what happened in the previous session, and without holding on to any hopes, expectations, or fears of what may happen in the next session, over time definite signs of lasting progress will arise - and this is a guaranteed by-product of consistency.<br/>Not only do we begin to notice more ups than downs during our formal practice sessions, but we also begin to experience other signs of progress creeping into our daily lives - positive emotions begin to almost effortlessly arise instead of disturbing ones.<br/>The more we experience all of these signs, the more we are inspired to continue on the path - and the life of the practitioner will become truly joyous.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Those who dispute intellectually, who are eager to insult other doctrines, who are clever only with words, or who refrain from only a single false activity, such as keeping their celibacy mainly out of false pride, are only protecting their vows up to the first layer of foreskin. With their own words and the ego of moral superiority, they have misinterpreted the teachings of the great guides who see the true meaning of the uncontrived essential nature. They change the extraordinary, absolute teaching of supreme Vajradhara into their own ordinary, relative meaning. These intellectual philosophers cannot understand the essence beyond the limits of their own minds.',a:'Jigme Lingpa'},
    {q:'You can choose to bring harmony, happiness, understanding and enlightenment to the world. This can start today – simply share your warmth with others.',a:'Gyalwang Drukpa'},

    {q:'Resolve the view definitively!<br/>Refine the practice repeatedly!',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Shifting your concern from your own well-being to include a genuine concern for the other person can transform your relationships, and it can also transform you as a person. You can become a person who provides well-being to others, and who shoulders the burden for others, too. This is a very uncomplicated shift in outlook that can completely reorient your relationships. I think this outlook might yield the healthiest relationships of all.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'With bodhicitta one enjoys happiness. With bodhicitta one enjoys even sorrow. With bodhicitta one enjoys what is there. With bodhicitta one enjoys even what is not there.<br/>It is because of bodhicitta that one gives up the pleasure of meditative concentration, and in order to relieve others of their suffering, goes down to the deepest hell as if into a pleasure park.',a:'Khunu Lama Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A healthy mind is the true key to happiness ~ We spend so much energy on physical health and hygiene, but we need to spend also more time on mental hygiene and the hygiene of emotion.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'For a dharma practitioner, wealth is not gold, silver, or a healthy bank account; wealth is contentment—the feeling that you have enough and need nothing more.<br/>Jigme Lingpa went on to say that although renunciants may not necessarily hunger for wealth, they might well long for fame, which he warned practitioners, is even worse than craving for wealth.',a:'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Be like the earth, which supports all living creatures indiscriminately, without distinguishing good from bad.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Life is fragile, like the dew hanging delicately on the grass, crystal drops that will be carried away on the first morning breeze.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The view of the Great Perfection is that all sentient beings at this time possess the essence of the sugatas, the foundational buddha nature; this is the basis of all sentient beings.<br/><br/>When one ascertains the nature as it is, this ascertainment is called the "view". The view then is the primary practice. Maintaining the view for months and years, with enthusiastic effort, is called "meditation". While one is engaged in meditation, the unfailing ability to observe one\'s behavior according to cause and result is called the "conduct".<br/><br/>All dharmas, including samsara, nirvana, and the path, have no true, inherent existence whatsoever and are nothing other than the nature of utter openness, or emptiness. This type of meditation will eventually lead to the unmistaken realization of the non-duality of appearance and emptiness. Appearance does not become void, and voidness does not become appearance. Appearance and voidness are experienced in a state of non-duality.<br/><br/>When the conflicting emotions and their habitual propensities are cleared, you will be able to see that your primordial nature is perfectly pure, and that this purity is the nature of existence and the nature of each and every one of us.<br/><br/>When you are able to become free from the stain of dualistic grasping and clinging, through the practice of the view, meditation, and conduct, you will then realize the all-pervasive purity of phenomenal existence and that the primordial nature of each and every sentient being is that of a perfect buddha.',a:'Yangthang Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Until you perfect the power of inner realization’s noble qualities, it is inappropriate to tell whomever you meet the stories of your spiritual experiences. Keep your mouth shut.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The more you are preoccupied by your own physical aging, the more anxious you will become. Do not worry so much about your physical appearance. Concentrate, rather, on not wasting your life. Practice the Dharma. The more you engage in it, the more your satisfaction will grow.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Nowadays disciples go to their masters making a request like, “Please kindly bestow an pith instruction to me!” This sounds like the masters are not allowed to give other dharma teachings, because disciples want pith instruction only. However, Kadampa practitioners had already realized that all Buddha’s teachings are pith instructions. We have not realized this yet. Therefore we are still looking for pith instruction…some pith instruction that is not taught by the Buddha.',a:'Yangthang Tulku  Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If your mind is pure, everyone is a Buddha.<br/>If your mind is impure, everyone is ordinary.',a:'Trulshik Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Wise people look for their own flaws, but fools look for the faults of others. The peacock examines his own body, but the owl sends out a bad omen to others.',a:'Sakya Pandita'},
    {q:'If we have ambitions, we have fixations toward whatever we are aiming for—even if our aim is enlightenment. Then there is no meditation because we are thinking about it, we are craving for it, we are fantasizing about it, imagining things. That is not meditation.<br/>This is why a very, very important characteristic of shamatha meditation is to let go of any goal and simply sit for the sake of sitting. Here we breathe in and out and we just watch that. Nothing else. It doesn\'t matter if we get enlightenment or not, or if our friends gets enlightened faster than us. Who cares? We are just breathing. We just sit straight and watch the breath in and out. Nothing else.<br/><br/>We let go of obsessions toward aims and ambitions. This is a very important aspect. This includes even the perfection of the shamatha meditation, trying to do a perfect shamatha meditation. Even that we should get rid of. Just sit.',a:'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When someone insults us, we usually dwell on it, asking ourselves, ‘Why did he say that to me?’ and on and on. It’s as if someone shoots an arrow at us, but it falls short. Focusing on the problem is like picking up the arrow and repeatedly stabbing ourselves with it, saying, ‘He hurt me so much. I can’t believe he did that.’<br/><br/>Instead, we can use the method of contemplation to think things through differently, to change our habit of reacting with anger.<br/>Imagine that someone insults you. Say to yourself, ‘This person makes me angry. But what is this anger?’ It is one of the poisons of the mind that creates negative karma, leading to intense suffering. Meeting anger with anger is like following a lunatic who jumps off a cliff. Do I have to go likewise? While it’s crazy for him to act the way he does, it’s even crazier for me to do the same.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A scholar without method is nothing, no matter how much he or she knows. Look at the Dalai Lama, he can sit anywhere, high or low, he doesn\'t care. Others, by contrast, can’t just sit anywhere; they feel they need a special place to sit. That means they don’t have method and wisdom together.<br/>In the future, if you have learned many things and then you pop up, thinking you are something special, that means you blew it! It means you couldn’t give up the afflictive emotions, the five poisons. You didn’t get real method or real wisdom.<br/>You don’t need to go anywhere; you already have it. What you need is to study and train in pure appearances. Then, your grasping to ordinary reality, grasping to this and that as good or bad, grasping to subject and object as impure: all these will decrease slowly.',a:'Gyatrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'No words can describe it <br/>No example can point to it <br/>Samsara does not make it worse <br/>Nirvana does not make it better <br/>It has never been born <br/>It has never ceased <br/>It has never been liberated <br/>It has never been deluded <br/>It has never existed <br/>It has never been nonexistent <br/>It has no limits at all<br/>It does not fall into any kind of category.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Studying the Dharma is an absolutely vital part of our path. But if we never practice what we\'ve studied, it\'s as if we have built the most magnificent ship, but then never using it for what it\'s intended for - to cross the ocean of samsara, to the shores of liberation and enlightenment.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Pleasure-seeking practitioners who fail to turn their minds from this life’s concerns,<br/>Sever their connection to the authentic Dharma.<br/>So take care to avoid becoming stubbornly immune to the teachings.',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If the root of a tree is medicinal, then the fruit will be medicine. But if the root is poisonous, then the fruit will be poison. Likewise, positive and negative qualities come from one’s motivation, and not from one’s physical actions in themselves.',a:'Jigme Lingpa'},
    {q:'That’s the position in which most of us find ourselves. We believe deep down that we’ve lost something precious and are seeking it outside ourselves, never realizing that we are carrying it within us wherever we go.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A stone dropped into water will cause a ripple to move outwards in all directions, continuing on long after the stone left the hand. So too, any action of our body, speech, or mind has the potential to cause a ripple effect within the interconnectedness of all phenomena, continuing on long after the action was carried out or forgotten.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The purpose of meditation is to see the peaceful, compassionate, pure, and already free nature of mind. But please remember that at the same time, meditation does not come with any hope or expectation.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you have really assimilated the teachings properly, everything you do, say and think should be as soft as stepping on cotton wool, and as mild as tsampa soup laced with butter.',a:'Patrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You never receive blessings just from asking,<br/>They come when you have gained devotion.',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Focusing on all sentient beings, practice the four boundless qualities: love, which is the wish that they be happy; compassion, the wish that they be free from suffering; sympathetic joy, which is to feel happy when they are happy; and impartiality, which is to treat them impartially as equals, without attachment or aversion.',a:'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There are many ways of grasping at the meditative state. Some of you might be so blissful that you feel, \'Wow, it is so great to feel this. Even if I were to be pricked with a needle right now, it will probably also be a pleasant sensation. It won\'t hurt at all.\'<br/><br/>According to Dzogchen, it\'s perfectly all right to feel blissful. You don\'t have to avoid it, but neither should you hold on to it by clinging to or yearning for the feeling of bliss. Instead, recognize that which experiences, and simply allow the bliss to be a reflection in this mirror. Do not fixate upon it at all.',a:'Tsoknyi  Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There is a reason why, when we learn the six paramitas, generosity always comes first. As human beings we are so impatient, we want instant gratification, instant happiness, instant results. We often hear that if you are generous, in the future you will be rich. But that’s just a very simplistic way of explaining things. If you really think deeply about the practice of generosity, you see that it not only causes future happiness, the practice itself is instant happiness. When young children are asked to give something, they give it with such joy—giving is part of who we are. Even though many of us may have hidden agendas when we give presents, still the act of giving can bring so much joy and satisfaction.',a:'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Even if we were to study quite a lot and become very learned, if we only know the theories but don\'t assimilate them through reflection and actual practice itself, it would be like dying of thirst on the shores of a great body of fresh water.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You might dine on the finest meal of delicious meat and alcohol,<br/>But it all turns into something impure the very next morning,<br/>And there is nothing more to it than that.<br/>So be content with life-sustaining provisions and simple clothes,<br/>And be a loser when it comes to food, clothing and conversation.',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We may shout, ‘Let there be peace!’ but this won’t really bring peace. Peace will appear in the world around us only when each individual learns to tame the disturbances arising within his or her own mind.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you give in to aversion and anger, it’s as though, having decided to kill someone by throwing him into a river, you wrap your arms around his neck, jump into the water with him, and you both drown. In destroying your enemy, you destroy yourself as well.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'To encourage or inspire ourselves to further our meditation, instead of looking at how far we still have to go, we should look back at how far we’ve come and rejoice over that repeatedly. It’s the same as when we are weary from traveling. We should rest and look towards where we came from, as that will cheer us up.',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'When performing the meditation practice one should develop the feeling of opening oneself completely to the whole universe with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind, ridding oneself of all protecting barriers. Don\'t mentally split into two when meditating, one part of the mind watching the other like a cat watching a mouse. One should realize that one does not meditate to go deeply within oneself and withdraw from the world: complete openness of mind is the essential point.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Getting butter from milk is only possible because milk already contains cream. No one ever made butter by churning water. The prospector looks for gold in rocks and not in wood chips. Likewise, the quest for perfect enlightenment only makes sense because buddha-nature is already present in every being. Without that nature, all efforts would be futile.',a:'Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thaye'},
    {q:'You don’t understand that a moment’s action arising from anger is worse than a hundred actions arising from desire.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'People tend to plan their dharma practice, and especially like to dream of making a long retreat. We plan how the retreat hut should look, its shape and where it should be positioned; we plan the time to start our retreat, maybe one, two or three years from now. It is very easy to make such plans, but it is more difficult for these plans to become reality. Therefore it is more realistic to engage in Dharma practice today, right this moment, not tomorrow or next year. Practice now in whatever situation is at hand. Otherwise, your life can easily run out while planning to practice later. Do not make long-term plans.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The alternation of thoughts<br/>Of happiness and suffering, desire and aversion,<br/>Is nothing more than the play <br/>Of luminous emptiness and mind. <br/>Without altering whatever arises,<br/>Look at its nature, <br/>And you will perceive it as great bliss.',a:'Terdag Lingpa'},

    {q:'One may have guarded the threefold Vows very well, but if one’s mind has not been turned away from the three realms of samsara, if one hasn’t felt that the samsara is without any essence, and that the nature of samsara is suffering…For example, a jaundice patient would find oily food repulsive. If our mind cannot be turned away from the three realms of samsara as such, our practice would not be beneficial.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We think that the guru is only good for giving teachings, that the guru is only good for special things but not good for headaches or other problems. This is not the way to think. For every problem that you have, pray to the guru, receive his blessings and you will be free from it. In one Tantra, it says, “Years and years of doing meditation on the development or completion stages, or years and years of chanting mantras, cannot compare with one instant of remembering the guru.”',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It can be so empowering for us to understand, even on a conceptual level, that we are enlightened in our true nature.',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'In between sessions cultivate your appreciation of impermanence and death. Conditioned things have no attainable essence and are rife with problems. Consider how samsara\'s nature is also like this.<br/>Once you have realized how the play of all external appearance are like dream or illusion, let everything be within the equality of the experiential dimension of space.',a:'Longchenpa'},
    {q:'When heat, moisture, and fertile soil come together, you do whatever you can to sow grain. When you discover a deposit of gold or silver, you do whatever you can to exploit it. When the crops are ready in autumn, you do whatever you can to harvest them. When you have an escort to accompany you on a dangerous path, you redouble your energy. When you have labor and assistants, you accomplish your tasks. Now that you have a precious human life free of all impediments and endowed with all favorable conditions, apply yourself unrelentingly to spiritual practice!',a:'Shechen Gyaltsab'},

    {q:'Even though one is a well-learned scholar, or a well-disciplined one, or an expert of teaching dharma, or an experienced meditator, if one’s mind has not been turned away from the Eight Worldly Concerns, one’s practice would not be the path to the next life.” What does this mean? Some are very knowledgeable. They can explain sutra or mantra so freely. Some are very disciplined. They abide in the threefold Vows and do not violate any vow. Some are so well learned that they can teach whatever dharma to teach. And some know about how to practice dharma. However, if one’s mind cannot be turned away from the Eight Worldly Concerns, whatever one teaches or practices would be merely words. This kind of dharma would not be the dharma that brings benefit to the next life.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There is no emotion that you cannot be rid of, because emotions are simply thoughts, and thoughts are just like the wind moving through the empty sky. There is nothing to them.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Illusion immediately becomes more workable when we acknowledge it as simply an illusion. The Western habit is to work against the grain and to try and organize the illusory into something solid and structured…<br/>In the stressful attempt to nail down the illusory nature of things, our chance to be at ease, spacious, awake, and free, which already exists within ourselves, gets lost.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When struck by the desire arrow, all of our common sense, sobriety, and sanity go out the window while false dignity, decadence, and immorality trickle in. Poisoned, we stop at nothing to get what we want. Someone struck with passion might even find a streetwalking hippopotamus sexy, even as a beautiful girl loyally waits for him at home. Like moths to the flame and fish to baited hooks, many on this earth have been ensnared by their desire for food, fame, praise, money, beauty, and respect.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It\'s a big stretch for the heart to go from having room for one person—or the few people around us—to having room for all living beings. We will feel some pain. The heart, however, is elastic. If we challenge it to grow, the heart can stretch to the limits of space without breaking.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is present and transparent, utter openness,<br/>Without outside, without inside,<br/>An all pervasiveness,<br/>Without boundary and without direction.<br/><br/>The wide-open expanse of the view,<br/>The true condition of the mind,<br/>Is like the sky, like space,<br/>Without center, without edge, without goal.',a:'Shabkar'},

    {q:'Just as a doctor doesn’t fight with a (patient)<br/>Seized by demons and rage;<br/>Likewise, a sage sees the disturbing emotions as the enemy,<br/>Not the person who’s possessed with these emotions.',a:'Aryadeva'},
    {q:'It is such a mistake to assume that practicing dharma will help us calm down and lead an untroubled life; nothing could be farther from the truth. Dharma is not a therapy.<br/>Quite the opposite, in fact, dharma is tailored specifically to turn your life upside down—it’s what you sign up for.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You keep going. That is the bodhisattva\'s way. As long as it benefits even one being you have to, without any sense of discouragement, go on.',a:'16th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Death has become a consumer product. Most of us do not contemplate the nature of death on a deep level. We don’t acknowledge that our bodies and environment are made up of unstable elements that can fall apart with even the slightest provocation.<br/>Of course we know that one day we will die. But most of us, unless we have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, think that we are in the clear for the time being.<br/>On the rare occasion that we think about death, we wonder, How much will I inherit? or Where will they scatter my ashes? In that sense we are unsophisticated.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The everyday practice of dzogchen is just everyday life itself. Since the undeveloped state does not exist, there is no need to behave in any special way or attempt to attain anything above and beyond what you actually are. There should be no feeling of striving to reach some "amazing goal" or "advanced state."<br/><br/>To strive for such a state is a neurosis which only conditions us and serves to obstruct the free flow of Mind. We should also avoid thinking of ourselves as worthless persons - we are naturally free and unconditioned. We are intrinsically enlightened and lack nothing.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'One common misconception amongst practitioners is that in order to do any serious practice, you must first move either to Kathmandu or to a cave, and that by doing so the practice will automatically be accomplished.<br/><br/>This is simply not the case. You just have to look at the dharma students currently living in India and Nepal to see that geography does not guarantee spiritual progress. Some of these dharma bums have been resident in Kathmandu for thirty years or more, but they never change. Their minds are as inflexible as they were when they first arrived, sometimes even more so.<br/><br/>They continue to carry around exactly the same garbage as worldly people, but camouflage it under the guise of dharma practitioner, and although it is not difficult to see through their disguises, when you do, they can hardly bear the humiliation.<br/><br/>So be assured, it is not necessary to leave home in order to practice effectively.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Among Tibetans there is a saying that a person who thinks he is better or above others because he is wiser, more capable, more knowledgeable or learned is like someone sitting on the highest peak of the highest mountain. And what is it like on the peak of that mountain? It is very cold there. It’s very hard. It’s very lonely and nothing grows there. On the other hand, the person who cultivates humility and puts himself in a lower position is said to enjoy living on the fertile land of the planes.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you have a single good thought, never despise it. It is worth a celebration because it is all the drops of waters that gets collected and becomes something as vast as the ocean. While we have to aspire to have abundance of good thoughts and actions, don’t condemn yourself for only having only one single good thought. If it takes time to be a good person, it is worth it to be patient.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Whatever you do—walking, eating, sitting, and so forth—abandon laziness, indolence, apathy, negligence, and distraction. Master the habitual patterns that make you resist any change in your body, speech, and mind, even in the most insignificant activities. Once you have embarked on the path of liberation, it is inappropriate to behave in an ordinary way: observe your mind all the time with vigilance and lucidity. If you have committed a negative act, regret it and promise never to do it again. Be glad if you have committed none.',a:'Shechen Gyaltsab'},

    {q:'People like me are practicing dharma while thinking about fame and wealth. When people praise us, we feel happy. When we are criticized, we feel sad. When we are rich, we are happy. When we are not, we are sad. And so we look for methods to gain praises, methods to win fame, and methods to get wealthy. And we look for methods to get rid of the opposites. We think about getting some things and removing other things, and thus practicing sublime dharma is not happening.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},

    {q:'We usually appreciate only half of the cycle of impermanence. We can accept birth but not death, accept gain but not loss, or the end of exams but not the beginning. True liberation comes from appreciating the whole cycle and not grasping onto those things that we find agreeable. By remembering the changeability and impermanence of causes and conditions, both positive and negative, we can use them to our advantage. Wealth, health, peace, and fame are just as temporary as their opposites.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Most people, thinking of the future, make a lot of plans—but the future they plan for is only the very few years of this life. This is very shortsighted; we have such a long way to go in lives to come. Death is just the threshold, which we have to cross alone, aided only by our faith in the teacher and the Three Jewels and by our confidence in the practice. Relatives, friends, power, wealth, and whatever else we have become so used to relying on will simply no longer be there.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Simply hearing your spiritual teacher\'s practical instructions and knowing how to explain them to others does not liberate your own mindstream, so you must meditate. Even if you spend your whole life practicing a mere semblance of meditation - meditating in a stupor, cluttering the mind with fantasies, and taking many breaks during your sessions due to being unable to control mental scattering - no good experiences or realizations will arise. So it is important during each session to meditate according to your teacher\'s oral instructions.',a:'Lerab Lingpa'},

    {q:'Now that you\'ve gained the support of a human life, so hard to find,<br/>Aroused a mind of renunciation, so difficult to develop,<br/>Met an authentic master, so rarely encountered,<br/>And taken up the sacred Dharma, so scarcely discovered,<br/>Reflect, over and again, on the difficulty of finding<br/>Such a physical support providing all the right conditions for practice.<br/>If you fail to make use of the full human potential you now possess,<br/>Which is impermanent like a candle in the wind,<br/>Don\'t think that you can rely on it for a long time to come.<br/>At death and in the bardos, lacking the confidence of liberation,<br/>How frightening will be the next life\'s sufferings!<br/>When we must wander endlessly in samsara,<br/>How distressing it is to contemplate its nature!<br/>Whatever you can do to gain real confidence in this life,<br/>I, for one, will be most grateful!<br/>This is what I hope for you.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We all possess Buddha nature,<br/>so rather than thinking of ourselves as flawed sentient beings<br/>walking up slowly on the path,<br/>how about if we took the result - Buddhahood<br/>and brought it right at the start, and use that conviction as our path.<br/>So we start with the acknowledgement that we already are Buddhas, that actually the idea that we\'re traveling on a path is only very relative. Ultimately, we\'re already there.',a:'Jetsünma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'So if you waste your life now on endless minor tasks, you can be sure that at the time of death you will weep with regret and be stricken with intense anxiety, like a thief who has just been thrown into jail and anxiously anticipates his punishment.<br/>A person might find himself with nothing to eat, no clothes to wear, and no house to live in; but if his mind is filled with faith in his teacher and the Three Jewels, that person will both live and die with his heart always joyful and confident.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'This life passes as quickly as autumn clouds;<br/>Family and friends are like passers-by in a market;<br/>The demon of death approaches like twilight\'s shadows;<br/>What the future holds is like a translucent fish in cloudy waters;<br/>Life\'s experiences are like last night\'s dreams;<br/>The pleasures of the senses, like an imaginary party.<br/>Meaningless activities are like waves<br/>lapping on the surface of the water.',a:'Padmasambhava'},
    {q:'Patience is essentially the ability to bear with suffering. It is the fertile soil in which the flowers of Dharma can grow and spread their perfume of good qualities. Encircling these flowers like a protective fence are the three kinds of patience. The first is the patience to bear the sufferings and difficulties that occur while one is striving for the twofold goal: Buddhahood for one\'s own sake and the accomplishment of the welfare of others. The second kind of patience is the ability to put up with the injuries that others might inflict, while the third kind is the ability to confront, without fear or apprehension, the doctrine of emptiness and other profound teachings.',a:'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Whether we call it compassion, love, caring or a Buddhist term such as bodhicitta, it means the same thing: that in your actions, speech and thought you put others before yourself. Some of us practice meditation to achieve this understanding; others are able to understand this without formal meditation. But no matter how good compassion sounds when you talk about it, it really comes down to practicing it. And no one understands you as well as you do. You need the wisdom to look inward to see what kind of a person you are.',a:'Jetsün Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A scholar without method is nothing, no matter how much he or she knows. Look at the Dalai Lama, he can sit anywhere, high or low, he doesn\'t care. Others, by contrast, can’t just sit anywhere; they feel they need a special place to sit. That means they don’t have method and wisdom together.<br/><br/>In the future, if you have learned many things and then you pop up, thinking you are something special, that means you blew it! It means you couldn’t give up the afflictive emotions, the five poisons. You didn’t get real method or real wisdom.<br/><br/>You don’t need to go anywhere; you already have it. What you need is to study and train in pure appearances. Then, your grasping to ordinary reality, grasping to this and that as good or bad, grasping to subject and object as impure: all these will decrease slowly.',a:'Gyatrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Remember that judgement, of yourself or others, is the tail of ego.<br/>The more judgement you have, the more ego you have.<br/>The less judgement you have, the less ego you have.<br/>Use this to remind yourself. Over and over again.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Change is continuous. Day by day, one season slips into the next. Day turns into night and night to day. Buildings don’t suddenly grow old; rather, second by second, from the moment they’re constructed, they begin to deteriorate…<br/>Think of beings inhabiting this universe. How many people born a hundred years ago are still alive?…<br/>We see the play of impermanence in our relationships as well. How many of our family members, friends, and people in our hometown have died? How many have moved away, disappearing from our lives forever?…<br/>At one time we felt happy just being near a person we loved. Just to hold that person’s hand made us feel wonderful. Now maybe we can’t stand him, don’t want to know anything about him.<br/>Whatever comes together must fall apart, whatever was born must die. Continual change, relentless change, is constant in our world.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When comes the time to carry<br/>The load of life through death\'s door,<br/>One can take neither relatives, friends,<br/>Servants, nor possessions.<br/>Attached mind is instinctual mind:<br/>Abandon attachment.',a:'7th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'When we think continually about ‟I! I! I!” and only talk about ourselves, we considerably reduce the size of the world that we want to be ours. The events that occur in the narrow sphere of selfishness affect us deeply and will certainly disturb our inner peace. The situation is very different when we feel primarily concerned with others and bear in mind that they are so numerous that, in comparison, our own personal concerns are negligible. If on top of that our desire is to remove their suffering, we will not get discouraged. It will give us more courage and determination, in contrast to self-pity, which depresses us and reduces our courage.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Death is certain, but when it will arrive is not. One thing that’s for sure is that we are not going to live for one hundred years. One hundred years from now, pretty much everybody alive today will be dead. It is very important to remember impermanence. The Kadampa geshes used to remember impermanence all the time in order to avoid seeking the comfort of the temporal life. They felt that if they didn’t bring it to mind in the morning they were in danger of wasting the entire afternoon, and if they didn’t bring it to mind in the afternoon they were in danger of wasting the whole night. By constantly keeping impermanence in mind, they were able to prevent the meaningless thought seeking only the comfort of this life from arising.',a:'Khunu Lama Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If your intention is not clear, if you aren’t really weary of samsara, then going on retreat is just another game. Even if you stayed for your whole life, you would just be wasting time and you would not learn anything. Many animals spend their lives in caves or in the ground like groundhogs, just eating and shitting without practicing Dharma. The Buddha said that people who go on retreat without first understanding real Dharma have the solitude of a demon’s hook. The same is true for those who understand Dharma but have no intention of benefiting sentient beings, just wanting to go from samsara’s suffering to samsara’s vacation. When people who have spent time in solitude without understanding come out of retreat, only hair, beards, and fingernails are longer; otherwise, everything is the same. When they come out, they have more ego than before and they boast about their accomplishments with saintly pride or siddha arrogance.',a:'Thinley Norbu Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A king\'s robe or an old blanket can keep you warm.<br/>A gold throne or the bare ground can be your seat.<br/>A grand palace or a mud hut can be your shelter.<br/>A jewelled plate or a wooden pot can hold your food.<br/>The external world does not destroy your inner peace,<br/>But your attachment and aversion will.',a:'Chamtrul  Rinpoche'},
    {q:'May you have luck all the way to enlightenment.<br/>May you have proper time to eat.<br/>May you have luck to be ignored by your friends.<br/>May you have luck to see lots of springs.<br/>May you have luck to see lots of deaths.<br/>May you have the luck to appreciate and encounter the words of the Buddha, so when you die you have no fear of losing the things of which you never owned.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'No matter which dharma practice you engage in, from ngöndro to offering a single candle, always do it with the intention that your practice will benefit all sentient beings. In this context, benefit does not only mean giving practical help, such as offering food or medicine, or feeding people’s emotions, egos and delusions. Here, benefit includes aspiring to be instrumental in the enlightenment of all sentient beings; without such an aspiration, it is easy for dharma practice to become self-serving.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Mindfulness is the root of Dharma.<br/>Mindfulness is the fortress of the mind.<br/>Mindfulness is the aid to the wisdom of innate wakefulness.<br/>Lack of Mindfulness will allow the negative forces to overcome you.<br/>Without Mindfulness you will be swept away by laziness.<br/>Lack of Mindfulness is the creator of evil deeds.<br/>Without Mindfulness and presence of mind, nothing can be accomplished.<br/>Lack of Mindfulness piles up lots of shit.<br/>Without Mindfulness you sleep in an ocean of piss.<br/>Without Mindfulness you are a heartless zombie, a walking corpse.<br/>Dear Dharma friends, please be mindful!<br/>By the aspiration of the holy lamas, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and lineage masters,<br/>May all Dharma friends attain stable Mindfulness and ascend the throne of Perfect Awakening.',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},

    {q:'In the beginning, you should be pursued by the fear of birth and death, like a deer escaping from a trap. In the middle, you should have nothing to regret, even if you die at this moment, like a peasant who has worked his land with care. In the end, you should be happy, like someone who has completed an immense task...<br/>The most important thing to know is that there is no time to lose, as if an arrow had hit a vital spot in your body.',a:'Gampopa'},

    {q:'If you want to totally free yourself from suffering, it is important to distinguish what to do from what not to do since you cannot hope to taste the fruit of beneficial actions that you have not done, nor escape the consequences of your own harmful actions. After death, you will follow the course traced by your actions, good and bad. Now that you have a choice between two paths, one that leads up and one that leads down, do not act in a way opposed to your deepest wishes. Practice all possible beneficial actions, even the smallest. Doesn\'t the accumulation of little drops end up filling a large jar?',a:'Jetsün Mingyur Paldrön'},
    {q:'Each step may seem to take forever, but no matter how uninspired you feel, continue to follow your practice schedule precisely and consistently. This is how we can use our greatest enemy-habit, against itself.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When about to settle in the natural way of mind-essence, some people merely try to stay conscious and aware. Then they rest in this state of mental consciousness with the feeling: “Ah, how clear!” Other people fixate on a state of utter void as if their mind had gone blank.<br/><br/>Both of these cases, however, are simply aspects of consciousness clinging to a dualistic experience. Whenever this duality occurs — between the clarity and the one perceiving clarity, the emptiness and the one perceiving emptiness—look into the nature of this stream of rigidly fixated mindfulness. By doing so, you pull up the stake to which the dualistic mind, which holds to a perceiver and something perceived, is tethered, and make room for the naked, wide-open natural state of awareness — a luminous emptiness without center or edge.<br/><br/>To apprehend in a nondual way this luminous and open, natural state is the essence of awareness. It is the dawn of naked wisdom, free from the veils of fixated experience.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Do not do any harmful act, even the most insignificant.

Avoid any harmful conduct like poison, understanding that it is the cause of all your suffering, and also transform neutral actions into positive ones.',a:'Jetün Mingyur Paldrön'},
    {q:'Love means wishing for the happiness of others.<br/>Like a loving mother cherishing her child,<br/>One\'s body, wealth, and virtue all amassed one gives for others\' benefit,<br/>While training to endure the harms that they inflict.<br/><br/>Compassion is a powerful state of mind,<br/>An inability to tolerate the fact that others suffer.<br/>Beings in the six realms are entrapped by sorrow and its cause,<br/>And seeing this brings tears to one\'s eyes.<br/><br/>Joy is to delight in other\'s pleasure and success;<br/>It is to cultivate the wish that all have happiness.<br/>It is a joy one feels when they achieve it for themselves<br/>And is the wish that they should never be deprived of it<br/><br/>Impartiality is freedom from attachment and hostility,<br/>When sides and factions are all seen as equal,<br/>When enemy and friend and neither -<br/>Are all treated with an evenhanded kindness.<br/>We should practice these four attitudes, remembering<br/>That all is without true existence.',a:'Jigme Lingpa'},

    {q:'When your realization of the emptiness of all phenomena becomes as vast as the sky, your confidence in the law of causality of actions will grow proportionately, and you will become aware of the real significance of your conduct. In fact, relative truth is inseparable from absolute truth. The profound realization of the empty nature of all things has never led anyone to believe that positive actions do not create happiness and negative actions do not cause suffering.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Be ever mindful of the shortcomings of desire’s rewards, and know that all the phenomena of the cycle of existence are never still, like the ripples on a pond, and that these manifestations of delusion, which are no things in themselves, are like magic and dreams. When you have the determination to be free of samsara and are content with your material situation, you will be able to sit quietly with your mind happy and at ease.',a:'Kalu Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The mind is malleable: it is capable of change. So we need to learn to see how we can transform it. We need to identify the ways to achieve that transformation and put them into action. Samsara, the circle of existences, and nirvana, the state beyond it, are not like geographical locations far from one another. They are two states of mind. Samsara is a deviation from knowledge, a distorted vision of reality that makes the mind the slave of negative emotions, while nirvana is a state of inner freedom, free of any conceptual and emotional obstacles.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},

    {q:'Millions of people in this world are interested in some version of meditation, or yoga, or one of the many so-called spiritual activities that are now so widely marketed. A closer look at why people engage in these practices reveals an aim that has little to do with liberation from delusion, and everything do to with their desperation to escape busy, unhappy lives, and heartfelt longing for a healthy, stress-free, happy life. All of which are romantic illusions. So, where do we find the roots of these illusions? Mainly in our habitual patterns and their related actions. Of course, no one of sound mind imagines any of us would willingly live an illusion. But we are contrary beings, and even though we are convinced we would shun a life built on self-deception, we continue to maintain a strong grip on the habits that are the cause of countless delusions.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The obstacles that we may face include having expectations, lack of self-confidence, indifference, and unwholesome distractions and activities. If we keep entertaining these negative acts and not believing in ourselves, thinking, “I’m not doing the practice well enough,” “I’m not capable,” “Everything is fated, so why should I try?”—at best, these acts and thoughts will divert us from our goal and slow down our spiritual progress. At worst, indulging in distractions, unwholesome activities, and negative attitudes will drag us on the wrong track and slowly lead us into the worst possible way of living, destroying all the possible fruits that this amazing human life could bring us.',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'I hope and pray that from the illuminating rays of the sun of the holy Dharma mandala, breezes of compassion emanate to cleanse all clouds of obscuration so stainless wisdom sky is seen.',a:'Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In the natural state as it is, we should not become distracted by the external display, nor should we grasp internally. We should experience a state where there is not even a hair\'s worth of clinging or grasping to any experience.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Just as a little salt—a few fractions of a measure—can make a small amount of water taste salty but cannot change a huge river like the Ganges, know that, in the same way, even a small negative action can harm someone whose positive deeds are weak but cannot harm anyone who has frequently performed immensely positive actions, vast in scope. So we should try to perform powerful positive actions repeatedly on a vast scale.',a:'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Emptiness and luminosity are not two separate things, but rather the nature of emptiness is luminosity, and the nature of luminosity is emptiness. This indivisible emptiness-luminosity, the naked mind, free of everything, dwells in the uncreated state.',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you’ve been practicing for years, you should be seeing some results, If you’re not, you may be missing the point.<br/><br/>The result of spiritual practice should be our inner transformation into better human beings. After practicing for months or years, we should be less prone to anger, pride, and jealousy. Our practice should lead us to a vaster, calmer mind.<br/><br/>For example, the whole point of dieting is to lose a few pounds, not to collect knowledge and become an expert on each and every diet. You may have heard about different diets and read many books, but you won’t lose weight unless you put one of them into practice in your everyday life. Similarly, if you do not implement the teachings, your destructive emotions and self clinging will not diminish, and the Dharma instructions will be of no use to you, no matter how many you receive.',a:'Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Alert, alert<br/>Yet relax, relax.<br/>This is a crucial point for the view in meditation.',a:'Machig Labdrön'},
    {q:'No intelligence, no power, no wealth or strength can help someone without diligence – he is like a boatman whose boat has everything but oars.',a:'Jigme Lingpa'},
    {q:'These days, though, just to find the time to be entirely alone to practise can be extremely problematic, especially for those with families, and so to organise the ideal place would be an unimaginable luxury. So keep it simple and do your best to be completely alone for an hour or two every day.<br/><br/>As Jigme Lingpa said, the greatest merit of all is to be able to remain alone and do nothing but practise the dharma; even an offering of the entire world and everything in it would not be enough to merit the chance of practising in isolation. He also said it is only possible to see the flaws of samsara and the benefits of nirvana in solitude. So pray from the bottom of your heart that one day you will encounter such an opportunity.<br/>Another very good reason for remaining alone is that it is so rare to meet unbiased people who compliment the dharma and harbour no envy.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Practice is about enjoying your mind. Don\'t make a project out of it.',a:'Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel'},
    {q:'Each morning after you wake up, try to shape your thinking in beneficial ways before you begin your day. You can think, for instance, \'May my body, my speech, and my mind be used in a more compassionate way, so that they become a service to others.\' This is something I usually do. It makes life more meaningful. Likewise, examine your mind in the evening before you go to bed. Review the way you spent your day, and check whether it was worthwhile.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Suffering, in fact, can be helpful in many ways. It spurs your motivation and as many teachings point out, without suffering there would be no determination to be free from samsara. Sadness is an effective antidote to arrogance.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'To partially illustrate the nature of the mind, the analogy of space is used. The mind is likened to space because space has no shape, no color, and no characteristic. It is free from any conditioning or characteristic at all. In this way the example of space provides a suitable analogy to illustrate the nature of the mind. But there are other aspects to the mind - its radiant clarity and unobstructed compassion - that space doesn’t possess.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we are serious about fostering world peace, we must first understand, generate, and experience real peace in our own mind. Awareness of peace is the foundation and goal of healing ourselves and the world. If our mind, or consciousness, is enjoying the awareness of peace, our everyday life will turn into a life of peace. Whatever we say will resound as the words of peace. Whatever we do will manifest as the expression of peace. Our mere presence will make the hearts of many blossom with happiness and harmony. Then we become one of the true peaceful members of society and a source inspiring others to true peace, too. Our every word and smile will send a genuine message of peace to others, and a true cycle of world peace and joy could be set in motion. So the inspiration of true world peace must take birth in our own heart.',a:'Tulku  Thondup'},

    {q:'Drop any feelings of hostility or ill will,<br/>And be happy, wherever you choose to go.',a:'Atiśa Dīpaṃkara'},

    {q:'Whenever we are harmed by sentient beings or anything else, if we make a habit out of perceiving only the suffering, then when even the smallest problem comes up, it will cause enormous anguish in our mind.',a:'Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima'},
    {q:'If we can do something to solve a problem, then there is no need to worry or be unhappy about it; if we can\'t, then it doesn\'t help to worry or be unhappy about it either.',a:'Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima'},
    {q:'As long as we don\'t get anxious and irritated, then our strength of mind will enable us to bear even the hardest of sufferings easily; they\'ll feel as flimsy and insubstantial as cotton wool. But while we are dominated by anxiety, even the tiniest problem becomes extremely difficult to cope with, because we have the additional burden of mental discomfort and unhappiness.',a:'Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima'},

    {q:'You might complain: \'I didn\'t do anything bad, or very little, in this life, so why do I go through such suffering?\' It\'s easy for karma to increase. Just as how from a tiny seed in the earth, a lot of fruit can grow. The results of one action (karma) can multiply enormously, as they themselves spawn further consequences, like a family tree.',a:'Alak Zenkar Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Horses and donkeys with sores on their backs<br/>Are an easy prey for scavenging birds.<br/>People who are prone to fear,<br/>Are easy victims to negative spirits.<br/>But not those whose character is stable and strong.',a:'Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima'},
    {q:'However much a crow looks after a baby cuckoo, it can never turn it into a baby crow.

    {q:'Whenever happiness and the various things that cause happiness appear, if we slip under their power, then we will grow increasingly conceited, smug and lazy, which will block our spiritual path and progress.',a:'Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima'},
    {q:'Even though we may be happy, if we don\'t recognize it, we will never be able to make use of that happiness as an opportunity for practising the Dharma.

    {q:'There is no better prayer or offering that we can offer to Buddha, than being thoughtful, kind, compassionate and abstaining from taking the life of any fellow human being, animal, bird, fish or insect.',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Once you have understood the union of emptiness and the dependent arising of phenomena, you will see clearly how deluded and deceiving the ways of the world really are, and, like an old man forced to play children\'s games, you will find them very tiresome. When you have realized the utter foolishness of spending your life attached to friends and scheming to subdue your enemies and competitors, you will find it tedious. Once you have been struck by the pointlessness of letting yourself be forever influenced and conditioned by your habitual tendencies, you will become sick of it. That will inspire you to strive towards liberation—and by striving for it, you will attain it.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'By and large, human beings tend to prefer to fit in to society by following accepted rules of etiquette and being gentle, polite, and respectful. The irony is that this is also how most people imagine a spiritual person should behave. When a so-called dharma practitioner is seen to behave badly, we shake our heads over her audacity at presenting herself as a follower of the Buddha. Yet such judgments are better avoided, because to “fit in” is not what a genuine dharma practitioner strives for.<br/><br/>Think of Tilopa, for example. He looked so outlandish that if he turned up on your doorstep today, you probably would refuse to let him in. And you would have a point. He would most likely be almost completely naked; if you were lucky, he might be wearing some kind of G-string; his hair would never have been introduced to shampoo; and protruding from his mouth would quiver the tail of a live fish. What would your moral judgment be of such a being? “Him! A Buddhist?” This is how our theistic, moralistic, and judgmental minds work. Of course, there is nothing wrong with morality, but the point of spiritual practice, according to the vajrayana teachings, is to go beyond all our concepts, including those of morality.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If our nature wasn\'t already enlightened, we couldn\'t awaken to it no matter how hard we tried. Buddha nature cannot be fabricated. Our nature is primordially enlightened, but at present our ordinary body, speech and discursive thinking obscures it. The nature of our mind, buddha nature, is like space itself, but it is space obscured by clouds. The whole point of Dharma practice is to remove the clouds and allow the actualization of what already is – the awakened state of mind, the buddha nature. The nature of our mind is primordially pure, primordially enlightened.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Right now, you have all the help you need, in your own hands. Even though you cannot manage many different kinds of Dharma practice, if you can keep a good heart and be kind to everyone, dedicate the merit and make wholesome prayers of aspiration, maintain the unborn nature of the mind which is the union of clarity and emptiness, and always remember the lama and pray to him, that is the heart of all the sutras and tantras.',a:'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö'},
    {q:'Shunyata means that you do not need the reference point of some solid entity in relating with your friends, your food, your clothing, your world, or your accommodations. You can actually open yourself up. You have no personal territory, no personal game, no actual personal entity that provokes your existence or the notion of your existence. You still are what you are, but “you” is not what you are. “You” is not. That is the shunyata approach: “you” is not. You are not even a grain of sand, not even dust. You don’t exist. Therefore, you exist so much. You are brilliant, luminous, skillful, and at peace. Because you have given so much territory away, you actually can work with others. You have not vanished into thin air.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You should try to meditate regularly on death and impermanence and thus become a spiritual practitioner of initial scope. Then you should develop the meditations on the unsatisfactory nature of samsara and the three higher trainings [ethics, concentration and wisdom] and thus become a practitioner of medium scope. Finally, you should give birth to love, compassion, universal responsibility and bodhicitta and thus enter the path of the practitioner of great scope, the Mahayana, which has full buddhahood as its goal. Relying on the guidance of a spiritual master, you should cultivate the seeds of bodhicitta in connection with the wisdom of emptiness and, for the sake of all that lives, quickly actualize buddhahood. This may not be an easy task, but it has ultimate perfection as its fruit.',a:'Ling Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Enlightenment is like the moon reflected on the water. The moon does not get wet, nor is the water broken. Although its light is wide and great, the moon is reflected even in a puddle an inch wide. The whole moon and the entire sky are reflected in one dewdrop on the grass.',a:'Dogen Zenji'},
    {q:'When we are angry, when we are excited, when we are depressed, when we are elated, we are completely submerged in and identified with those thoughts and feelings. This is why we suffer.

    {q:'Every mother-being wants to be happy, just as a thirst-tormented person wants water. Most beings, however, have no idea how to secure happiness. Confused, they grasp at anything that they think will be rewarding. But they go about it in the wrong way—through grasping, attachment, obsession, or aggression. At best, they are chasing rainbows. At worst, they end up hurting themselves, like someone who tries to lick honey off the sharp edge of a knife.',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'If someone defames and disgraces you, that is simply the result of having criticized and dishonored others in the past, especially bodhisattvas. Instead of feeling angry with such people, you should feel grateful to them for giving you the opportunity to purify your past misdeeds.<br/><br/>In all circumstances, it is important to act in accordance with the teachings - but especially at such moments. What is the point of having received teachings if you do not apply them? Unfavorable circumstances are the best opportunity you will have to put the teachings into practice.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'No matter how rough the surface of the ocean becomes, a great stillness can be found below. So too, beneath the turbulence of disturbing emotions, a vast expanse of peace awaits.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A bodhisattva is someone who has taken on the sole task of meeting the needs of others, no matter how difficult that might be. His self-centeredness has been reduced to the point where wisdom, love, and compassion arise naturally, benefiting any situation. Motivated only by concern for others, he would offer his own life without regrets if he saw it would be of help. So the mind of a bodhisattva is heroic, vast, and of limitless benefit.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you run after your thoughts, you are like a dog chasing a stick - every time a stick is thrown, you run after it. But if instead you look at where your thoughts are coming from, you will see that each thought arises and dissolves within the space of that awareness, without giving rise to other thoughts. Be like a lion, who rather than chases after the stick, turns to face the thrower. One only throws a stick at a lion once.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Look into the awakened mind of your own awareness! It has neither form nor color, neither center nor edge. At first, it has no origin but is empty. Next, it has no dwelling place but is empty. At the end, it has no destination but is empty. This emptiness is not made of anything and is clear and cognizant. When you see this and recognize it, you know your natural face. You understand the nature of things. You have then seen the nature of mind, resolved the basic state of reality and cut through doubts about topics of knowledge.<br/><br/>This awakened mind of awareness is not made out of any material substance; it is self-existing and inherent in yourself. This is the nature of things that is easy to realize because it is not to be sought for elsewhere. This is the nature of mind that does not consist of a concrete perceiver and something perceived to fixate on. It defies the limitations of permanence and annihilation. In it there is no thing to awaken; the awakened state of enlightenment is your own awareness that is naturally awake. In it there is no thing that goes to the hells; awareness is naturally pure. In it there is no practice to carry out; its nature is naturally cognizant. This great view of the natural state is present in yourself: resolve that it is not to be sought for elsewhere.',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Practice of renunciation is an invitation for growth. It\'s an invitation to shed our layers of self-imposed confinements and security narratives-- willfully abandoning the sense of comfort zones that may make us complacent. At times the choices greeting us are freedom by growth or vicious cycle of life and death, rest is all fabrications.',a:'Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi'},
    {q:'Beyond meditation practice, there is attitude. A beginner must learn to cultivate what is called, “the poise of a dying man”. What is this poise? It is the poise of knowing what is important and what is not, and of being accepting and forgiving. Anyone who has ever been at the bedside of a dying man will understand this poise. What would the dying man do if someone were to insult him? Nothing. What would the dying man do if someone were to strike him? Nothing. As he lay there, would he scheme to become famous or wealthy? No. If someone who had once offended him were to ask him for his forgiveness would he not give it? Of course he would. A dying man knows the pointlessness of enmity. Hatred is always such a wretched feeling. Who wishes to die feeling hatred in his heart? No one. The dying seek love and peace.',a:'Chan Master Hsu-Yun'},
    {q:'There is a difference between watching the mind and controlling the mind. Watching the mind with a gentle, open attitude allows the mind to settle down and come to rest. Trying to control the mind, or trying to control the way that one’s spiritual practice will unfold, just stirs up more agitation and suffering.',a:'Bhante Gunaratana'},
    {q:'If you do not implement the teachings, your destructive emotions and self clinging will not diminish, and the Dharma instructions will be of no use to you, no matter how many you receive.',a:'Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Now we are afflicted by "me-my-mine-itis," a condition caused by ignorance. Our self-centeredness and self-important thinking have become very strong habits. In order to change them, we need to refocus. Instead of concerning ourselves with "I" all the time, we must redirect our attention to "you" or "them" or "others." Reducing self-importance lessens the attachment that stems from it. When we focus outside ourselves, ultimately we realize the equality of ourselves and all other beings. Everybody wants happiness; nobody wants to suffer. Our attachment to our own happiness expands to an attachment to the happiness of all.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Although it is fairly easy to bring adverse circumstances into the path, doing the same for positive circumstances is very difficult. Even those who vainly assume themselves to be highly realized beings risk enslavement by the son of Mara and are distracted by devoting themselves to ways of becoming important in this life. Be very careful. Know that this marks the border line where you can go up or down, where the measure of great meditators is taken. Until you perfect the power of inner realization’s noble qualities, it is inappropriate to tell whomever you meet the stories of your spiritual experiences. Keep your mouth shut.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'By renouncing samsara, we renounce our habitual grasping, unhappy minds. And by renouncing samsara, we embrace our potential for enlightenment.',a:'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Bodhicitta can be defined as the realization of the nature of emptiness within which effortless compassion arises like heat arising from fire. Compassion, or bodhicitta, is inherent in emptiness as an innate quality, and if one has realized emptiness it is simply impossible that compassion would not be there.<br/>The nature of mind is introduced by way of practice by seeing that all appearances arise from the mind. They are nothing other than the expression of the mind. This must be realized: "objective" appearances all originate from the mind.<br/>The nature of the mind is then realized or introduced to be empty, and the nature of that emptiness, as experienced in meditation, is the primordial wisdom of great bliss. The mind is blissful and by nature empty, and that emptiness is recognized as rigpa, pure awareness.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Real fearlessness is the product of tenderness. It comes from letting the world tickle your heart, your raw and beautiful heart. You are willing to open up, without resistance or shyness, and face the world. You are willing to share your heart with others.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Within the all-pervasive expanse of the sky of great emptiness, without center or circumference,<br/>The shadowless sun of luminosity naturally arises, without emanating or dissolving,<br/>Thus the dense darkness of innate and conceptual ignorance simultaneously vanishes,<br/>And the gateway of the great illumination of clear primordial wisdom freely opens,<br/>Which is the vast expanse of the original primordial ground, free from restrictions and partiality.',a:'Lama Tharchin Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In the degenerated time, the Buddha-Dharma is even more potent, so the degenerated time should not be used as an excuse for discouraging oneself. It should be encouraging.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Many of us lead family lives. At most, the members of a family stay together for the duration of a single lifetime, often much less. While that fleeting moment of being together still lasts, we should try to remain in perfect harmony with each other, while observing the Dharma as much as possible. Night and day, let us turn our minds toward goodness, love, and compassion. Doing a single prostration, saying a simple prayer, contemplating the nature of the mind for an instant are seeds that lead to enlightenment. To be united in this life as man and wife, parent and children, is the result of our past actions, of a shared karma. That is why we should at all costs avoid quarelling and live in harmony.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A practitioner\'s attitude is:<br/>“It’s ok”. Relax. Wherever you are, be content about it, good or bad. Smile. Be gentle. Give advice to others that you take yourself.<br/>An attitude like this is how you will actually benefit more and more beings.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Activities are endless, like ripples on a stream. They end only when you drop them.<br/><br/>Human moods are like the changing highlights and shadows on a sunlit mountain range.<br/><br/>All activities are like the games children play, like castles being made of sand.<br/><br/>View them with delight and equanimity, like grandparents overseeing their grandchildren, or a shepherd resting on a grassy knoll watching over his grazing flock.',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Illusion immediately becomes more workable when we acknowledge it as simply an illusion. The Western habit is to work against the grain and to try and organize the illusory into something solid and structured…<br/><br/>In the stressful attempt to nail down the illusory nature of things, our chance to be at ease, spacious, awake, and free, which already exists within ourselves, gets lost.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},

    {q:'After knowing about the points of what is to be taken and what is to be discarded in an unmistaken way, we should adopt what is to be taken, and abandon what is to be adopted. This is mindfulness: “Not to forget the points concerning what is to be taken and what is to discarded.” We should not forget on regular basis. Are we doing what we should do? Or are we doing what is supposed to be discarded? We have to investigate this. Otherwise we wouldn’t know if we have traversed on the wrong path. Therefore, we should investigate whether we are doing our justice on what is to be taken up and what is to be discarded. We should not forget the points of what is to be adopted and what is to be abandoned on regular basis.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Focusing with effort just increases further thinking.<br/>A training full of judgements brings no progress.<br/>Keep undistracted and be free of meditating:<br/>This I found to be the greatest key advice.',a:'Tsele Natsok Rangdröl'},
    {q:'Birth and death are only ideas we have in our mind, and these ideas cannot be applied to reality. It is just like the idea of above and below. Heaven is above, and hell is below. But the people who are sitting right now on the other side of the planet must disagree, because the idea of the above and below does not apply to the cosmos, exactly like the idea of birth and death.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'Meditation on the impermanence of this life and the certainty of death is an extremely powerful method to destroy the delusions of anger and pride. If we want to destroy pride, anger, attachment and many other negative minds right away, the most powerful method is this meditation. If we want to relax and be happy, then we should remember the impermanence of life and death. If we are not happy with anger, our meditation on impermanence and death is so powerful, it can destroy the delusions like an atomic bomb.',a:'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The practice and teachings of Buddhism are not a way to feel good. They are a way to get bigger to accommodate more and more of life.',a:'Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel'},
    {q:'Avoid becoming attached to positive experience if it was peaceful. As with every mental experience, bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality spontaneously come and go. You didn’t create them, you didn’t cause them, and you can’t control them. They are simply natural qualities of your mind.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Indeed, adversaries and people who try to harm you can be powerful sources of help on the bodhisattva path. By bringing about situations which would normally trigger your anger or hatred, they give you the precious opportunity to train in transforming those negative emotions with patience. On the path, such people will do you far more good than any well-disposed friend.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'All too often, though, even so-called Buddhists misunderstand bodhichitta and reduce it to little more than compassionate loving-kindness. Love, compassion and wanting to make people happy are very popular ideals these days and are often promoted as bodhichitta’s most important features. We forget that without bodhichitta there would be no mahayana or vajrayana Buddhism, and that the most crucial aspect of both these yanas is the wisdom of understanding shunyata (emptiness). Without wisdom, compassion alone is not “bodhichitta,” and vice versa; both qualities are essential.',a:'Dzongsar Khyenste Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you think everything is someone else\'s fault, you will suffer a lot.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'if one were to summarize the Buddha\'s teaching in one word, we would have to say that it is universal interdependence, of which nonviolence is a natural consequence. Since we are all dependent on each other and all other beings want to be happy and not suffer, just as I do, my personal happiness and suffering are inextricably linked with those of others.<br/><br/>This nonviolence does not mean weakness or passivity. It is the deliberate choice of altruism in all our thoughts and actions, so that it becomes inconceivable to knowingly harm others.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'The aim of far too many teachings these days is to make people "feel good," and even some Buddhist masters are beginning to sound like New Age apostles. Their talks are entirely devoted to validating the manifestation of ego and endorsing the "rightness" of our feelings, neither of which have anything to do with the teachings we find in the pith instructions. So, if you are only concerned about feeling good, you are far better off having a full body massage or listening to some uplifting or life-affirming music than receiving dharma teachings, which were definitely not designed to cheer you up. On the contrary, the dharma was devised specifically to expose your failings and make you feel awful.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Leave your front door and your back door open. Allow your thoughts to come and go. Just don\'t serve them tea.',a:'Shunryu Suzuki Roshi'},
    {q:'There is nothing like the unavoidability of death to focus the mind on what is truly important in life – spiritual values.<br/><br/>We have all asked ourselves: “What should I do with my life?” The fact that we ask this shows that we have some notion that our time here is short and that we should use it wisely.<br/><br/>When we understand our mortality and the speed with which life is passing – not just intellectually, but from the heart, – we will innately know what to do with our time here. We will automatically want to deepen our spiritual qualities, for everything else is left behind at death.',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'As a Buddhist, you have been taught that aggression is generally considered to be a negative emotion. Therefore your immediate reaction to any aggressive tendency or thought that arises in your mind will be to reject it. And you reject it because you are in love with your “self,” which makes you an egoist. As an egoist, you do not want aggressive feelings or jealousy or any of the other negative emotions to spoil your chances of becoming renowned as a “good” Buddhist. Yet according to the greater view offered by the bodhisattvayana, to reject your aggression is a weakness. To reject the bad and only accept the good shows that you are still stained by the clinging to self that we call “ego.” Instead, when a bodhisattvayana practitioner notices his/her aggressive emotions, he/she should think, “Aggression is really bad! But I am not the only one who suffers from it — all sentient beings do! So, may I take on the aggression, jealousy and pride of all sentient beings.” From a relative point of view, what happens when you take on the pens when you take on the suffering of others in this way? Fundamentally, you go against the wishes of your ego. So, if your ego wants to be the holiest and most sublime of all beings so it can boast it has no desire or jealousy, this is exactly the practice you need to do to oppose and resist it. By continually applying it, the ego becomes smaller and smaller until finally it has nowhere to live.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When we have realized that, the guru who has taught us the dharma will not be outside us anymore, but inside.<br/><br/>Where inside? The guru is the nature of our mind. Once we have realized the nature of our mind, it is no longer necessary to search for the guru outside.<br/><br/>If the view of the mind is maintained beyond meditation and postmeditation, the guru is present beyond meeting and parting.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You might think you could practice zazen much better if you had no problem, but actually some problem is necessary. It doesn’t have to be a big one. Through the difficulty you have you can practice zazen.

Right there is enlightenment.',a:'Shunryu Suzuki Roshi'},

    {q:'Desire is the source of suffering both in this life and the next. Like moths drawn to the lovely candlelight that destroys them, people are attracted to the pleasing sound of flattery, enticed by the aroma of tobacco, the taste of meat, a lover\'s soft touch, and the caress of silken robes. Thus people are deceived and destroy the path to their own freedom.<br/>Lured by the sweet sound of a lute, the deer is shot with poisoned arrows; the bee is drawn by the perfume of the flower and is ensnared in its petals; the fish is caught on the hook, unable to resist the taste of the bait; and the elephant, craving contact with its mate, perishes in the quicksand. Beings are enticed by the objects of the senses and are constantly bound up with them.',a:'Jigme Lingpa'},
    {q:'The chances of finding a human existence are one in a hundred.<br/>Now that you have found one, if you fail to practice the sublime Dharma,<br/>How could you possibly expect to find such an opportunity again?<br/>This is why it’s crucial that you take advantage of your situation.<br/>Conceiving of your body as a servant or a thing to ferry you about,<br/>Don’t allow it to rest in idleness for even just a single moment;<br/>Use it well, spurring on your entire body, speech and mind to virtue.',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The adorning quality of this human existence is that one’s karma can be transformed. No matter how fragile and impermanent one’s life, one can transcend and purify one’s karma. If there is such a thing as cause and effect, then it also contains within it the wisdom of knowing that it can be a cause of happiness and liberation.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'An effortless compassion can arise for all beings who have not realized their true nature. So limitless is it that if tears could express it, you would cry without end. Not only compassion, but tremendous skillful means can be born when you realize the nature of mind. Also you are naturally liberated from all suffering and fear, such as the fear of birth, death and the intermediate state. Then if you were to speak of the joy and bliss that arise from this realization, it is said by the buddhas that if you were to gather all the glory, enjoyment, pleasure and happiness of the world and put it all together, it would not approach one tiny fraction of the bliss that you experience upon realizing the nature of mind.',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you are able, through your development of wisdom and skillful means, to unite the teachings with your life, then true results will be achieved.',a:'Gyatrul Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The forest is peaceful, why aren’t you? You hold on to things causing your confusion. Let nature teach you. Hear the bird’s song then let go. If you know nature, you’ll know Dhamma. If you know Dhamma, you’ll know nature.',a:'Ajahn Chah'},
    {q:'When the teachings say we need to reduce our fascination with the things of this life, it does not mean that we should abandon them completely. It means avoiding the natural tendency to go from elation to depression in reaction to life\'s ups and downs, jumping for joy when you have some success, or wanting to jump out the window if you do not get what you want. Being less concerned about the affairs of this life means assuming its ups and downs with a broad and stable mind.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'You might feel that you have some control of the mind or have made some progress in your practice, yet as soon as difficulties confront you, the mental poisons overwhelm your mind with the same strength as before. If this happens try to determine whether you are becoming a better being or not. Are you slowly getting free of the disturbing emotions? Are you enjoying the fulfillment of inner freedom?<br/>After years of practice, we should gain a sense of inner peace and become less vulnerable to outer circumstance. Masters such as Patrul Rinpoche experienced great joy and profound happiness as a result of their Dharma practice. Inner freedom, relaxed and open happiness, and joy will arise when disturbing emotions and mental confusions disappear. In contrast, we will have missed the point of the practice if our mental poisons are still all-powerful, torment us constantly, and cause us to remain preoccupied with ourselves.',a:'Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Since life is conditioned, it has no permanence.<br/>Since sense objects are perceptions, they have no true existence.<br/>Since the path stage is delusion, it has no reality.<br/>Since the ground is the natural state, it has no concreteness.<br/>Since mind is thought, it has no basis or root.<br/>I have yet to find any “thing” that truly exists.',a:'Yeshe Tsogyal'},
    {q:'Spending all your life trying to achieve ordinary worldly goals is like trying to net fish in a dry riverbed. Clearly understanding this, make a firm decision not to allow your life to pursue such a useless course.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'For a good practitioner, everything is favorable.<br/>For a bad practitioner, everything is adverse.',a:'Khenpo Sodargye'},
    {q:'True change is within; leave the outside as it is.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'As we get older, we naturally cultivate renunciation. We can nurture this quality by reflecting on the variety of experiences we\'ve already had. This automatically diminishes our craving to repeat similar experiences. We find ourselves no longer so driven to crank up our life in an attempt to have more and to accomplish more, since we\'ve already tasted that fruit, with all the accompanying emotions. We can begin to relax a little, being content with all that we\'ve experienced already in our life. This process of awareness and appreciation naturally generates a fuller sense of renunciation. It is not something that needs to be very deliberate, but rather it occurs more and more as our life unfolds, unless we try holding onto things too tightly. This natural renunciation is happening all the time. If we can just allow that process, and foster an attitude of "practice mind" to go with it, then there will be an increasing amount of renunciation occurring every year.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you put enough energy into practicing tonglen (taking and giving), that practice will become the very foundation of courage. Courageous compassion will increase so very much on the basis of such practice!',a:'Ribur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In the world these days, there is good education, economical development, many technologies. But what do we lack in the world?<br/>We lack kindness, love, and respect. Kindness brings peace to the heart. Kindness is antidote to all negative emotions. Kindness keeps away stress and depression. Kindness helps to get along with everyone.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Genuine renunciation involves determination to overcome ignorance, our real enemy. This determination begins to manifest when we realize that we are slaves of mental confusion and that there is little space for true happiness in our lives. When this feeling becomes unbearable, our only preoccupation is to get free.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'All of the teachings of Buddha are of one taste, one way - all leading to the truth, all arriving at the truth. Although there are different vehicles, they neither contradict each other, nor reject the basis of each other. The things that are fully made clear in the lower vehicles are neither changed nor rejected by the higher vehicles, but accepted as they are. The points that are not made completely clear in the lower vehicles are made clear in the higher vehicles, but the basic structure is not changed, and none of the points that are already clear are contradicted. Therefore, different vehicles and traditions do not go in different directions, and they do not arrive at different conclusions.',a:'Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo'},
    {q:'The energy of a storm has the power to cause a huge amount of destruction. But whoever harnesses that energy would be able to use it to bring a huge amount of benefit instead.<br/>Likewise, the energy that arises as the destructive emotions of desire, anger and so on, has so much potential power. And in Tantra this energy is not ignored. In Tantra it is turned towards the path to enlightenment.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'I feel much better when I am spontaneous, because it comes from the heart.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Atisha always placed a unique emphasis on the importance of a kind heart, and rather than ask people, "How are you?," he would say, "Has your heart been kind?"',a:'Patrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The sound of thunder, although deafening, is harmless;<br/>The rainbow, despite its brilliant colors, does not last;<br/>This world, though it appears pleasant, is like a dream;<br/>The pleasures of the senses, though agreeable, ultimately lead to disillusionment.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'I don’t like formality. There’s no formality when we’re born and none when we die. In between we should treat each other as brothers and sisters because we all want to live a happy life. This is our common purpose and our right. Nothing is guaranteed about the future, but we live in hope of being happy.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'In a sense everything is dreamlike and illusory, but even so, humorously you go on doing things. For example, if you are walking, without unnecessary solemnity or self-consciousness, lightheartedly walk toward the open space of truth. When you sit, be the stronghold of truth. As you eat, feed your negativities and illusions into the belly of emptiness, dissolving them into all-pervading space. And when you go to the toilet, consider all your obscurations and blockages are being cleansed and washed away.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The next time you lose heart and you can’t bear to experience what you’re feeling, you might recall this instruction: change the way you see it and lean in. Instead of blaming our discomfort on outer circumstances or on our own weakness, we can choose to stay present and awake to our experience, not rejecting it, not grasping it, not buying the stories that we relentlessly tell ourselves. This is priceless advice that addresses the true cause of suffering — yours, mine, and that of all living beings.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'Until you perfect the view,<br/>Don\'t count your practice in years or months,<br/>But decide to dedicate the whole remainder of your life to Dharma practice.<br/>This is the approach of the very best practitioners.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The best skillful means is \'not to contrive\'. Trying to contrive something in order to please others is not the skillful means of dharma.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Taking a guru will be nerve racking – any relationship is nerve racking but the relationship with a guru is more nerve racking than getting married. I would be very concerned and nervous, and cautious to take a guru if I were you. All the same, [when you do engage the relationship] there has to be a path to ease your mind...to further and further gain trust and confidence.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Measure yourself against the various stages of the path. See if you can bear sufferings such as illness, being undermined, and despised. To be unable to do so is to be ordinary, a sign that you have not completed the path.',a:'Khenpo Gangshar'},
    {q:'Lama-la, when you were around me, my eyes were always placed on the smiles of your form body (Rupakaya); when you are not around anymore, my heart is always linked to the subtleness of your truth body (Dharmakaya). You have never parted from me, always present.',a:'Khenpo Sodargye'},
    {q:'We should be really concerned with these questions: Am I really practicing in a genuine way? Am I really progressing? We need to check ourselves, again and again.<br/>As we practice more and more, the basic guideline is: are our disturbing emotions diminishing? Is wisdom developing and increasing? Yes or no? We should examine ourselves honestly in this way.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When we look at death and the impermanence of all things,<br/>Our ordinary projects are just a joke.<br/>How can you believe in the eight worldly preoccupations, <br/>Which are as transient as the colors of the rainbow?',a:'Drikung Jigten Gönpo'},
    {q:'Not to keep yourself from evil actions is to have no pratimoksha. <br/>Not to work for others’ welfare is to have no bodhicitta. <br/>Not to master pure perception is to have no Secret Mantra. <br/><br/>If illusions don’t collapse, there is no realization.<br/>If you opt for one side or the other, that is not the View.<br/>If you have a goal in mind, that is not the Meditation. <br/>If your conduct’s a contrivance, that is not the Action. <br/>If you hope and wish, you’ll have no Fruit. <br/><br/>Those with faith will go for refuge.<br/>Those who have compassion will have bodhicitta.<br/>Those with wisdom will gain realization.<br/>Those who have devotion harvest blessings.<br/>Those who have a sense of shame are careful how they act.<br/><br/>Careful in their actions, they are self-possessed.<br/>Self-possessed, they keep their vows and pledges.<br/>Keeping vows and pledges, they will have accomplishment. <br/><br/>Peaceful self-control is the sign of one who’s heard the teachings!<br/>Few defiled emotions are the mark of one who meditates. <br/>Harmony with others is the sign of one who practices. <br/>A blissful heart is witness to accomplishment. <br/><br/>The root of Dharma is your very mind. <br/>Tame it and you’re practicing the Dharma.<br/>To practice Dharma is to tame your mind— <br/>And when you tame it, then you will be free!',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The fault doesn’t necessarily always exist externally. If the analyzer is bound by hope and fear, more likely he or she will find endless faults. No one, not even the Buddha himself, can please everyone. His own cousin Devadata was disgusted by the Buddha. He spent all his life basically criticizing the Buddha’s deeds. Even though everyone saw the Buddha as a perfect being, Devadata did not.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The idea of a warrior is based on a sense of fundamental fearlessness. There is no reason why you should be a coward. It’s as simple as that. You are not being a warrior because a state of war exists in your country. We are not trying to win against the egohood people. We are not trying to fight with them. You are being a warrior because you are a warrior. If someone asks you, “Are you twenty-one years old?” you say, “Yes, I am.” They don’t ask you why you are twenty-one years old or how you have done this. You would have no answer for that. You are just twenty-one. Warriorship is a basic sense of unshakeability. It’s a sense of immovability and self-existing dignity rather than that you are trying to fight with something else.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'To believe that life\'s problems will somehow work themselves out, everything bad is fixable and something about samsara has to be worth fighting for makes it virtually impossible to nurture a genuine, all-consuming desire to practise the dharma. The only view that truly works for a dharma practitioner is that there are no solutions to the sufferings of samsara and it cannot be fixed.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'However thought of, it defies imagination.<br/>However spoken of, it cannot be discerned.<br/>But from the basic space of wakeful vastness,<br/>Shines forth a light that never need be sought.',a:'Shri Singha'},
    {q:'There will be times, for example, when you feel you are faking it. However hard you try genuinely to practice, it just doesn\'t feel right. And on the rare occasions it does feel authentic, the sensation is over almost before it began. So, try to be content with your practice, whatever it feels like, even when you are doing little more than paying it lip service, because at least you are making an effort.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Even if you are prosperous like the gods,<br/>Pray do not be conceited.<br/>Even if you become as destitute as a hungry ghost,<br/>Pray do not be disheartened.',a:'Nagarjuna'},
    {q:'When looking for the self it is very important to remember it is an emotional response that one is examining. When one responds to an event as if one had a self, for example when one feels very hurt or offended, one should ask oneself who or what exactly is feeling hurt or offended.',a:'Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When I began to practice meditation on compassion, I found that my sense of isolation began to diminish, while at the same time my personal sense of empowerment began to grow. Where once I saw only problems, I started to see solutions. Where once I viewed my own happiness as more important than the happiness of others, I began to see the well-being of others as the foundation of my own peace of mind.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'One day passes and another day comes along, and everything happens the same. But basically, we are so afraid of the brilliance coming at us, and the sharp experience of our life, that we can\'t even focus our eyes',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The first step in learning to appreciate the true value of the dharma is genuinely to admit and fully accept that samsara is a terminal illness, and one we all suffer from. This illness makes us weak and lethargic and lacking in any form of self-control, yet we remain firmly convinced that we are capable of managing and directing every aspect of our lives.<br/>We really believe we are in control. The reality is, of course, that we have no power whatsoever, and until we recognise and admit how ill we are, we have no hope of truly appreciating dharma.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We may still encounter the adversities of karmic patterns calling us back to cultivate or maintain the continuum of a mundane samsaric view. It is essential to develop a confidence that can withstand the constant, magnetic quality of this karmic impulse.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Most people feel cozy enough in samsara. They do not really have the genuine aspiration to go beyond samsara; they just want samsara to be a little bit better. It is quite interesting that “samsara” became the name of a perfume. And it is like that. It seduces us into thinking that it is okay: samsara is not so bad; it smells nice! The underlying motivation to go beyond samsara is very rare, even for people who go to Dharma centers. There are many people who learn to meditate and so forth, but with the underlying motive that they hope to make themselves feel better. And if it ends up making them feel worse, instead of realizing that this may be a good sign, they think there is something wrong with Dharma. We are always looking to make ourselves comfortable in the prison house. We might think that if we get the cell wall painted a pretty shade of pale green, and put in a few pictures, it won’t be a prison any more.',a:'Jetsünma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'When you have achieved a state of calmness and readiness, then you are ready to know, ready to understand in a deep way the dance between emptiness and appearance. Once you catch a glimpse of that dance, don’t hang on to it. Just let it go, like your first glimpse of essence love.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You don\'t understand that a moment\'s action arising from anger is worse than a hundred actions arising from desire.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'Right now, you might consider yourself young,<br/>But, with a wicked mind intent upon your own wellbeing,<br/>The daylight of your life will soon succumb to shadows.',a:'Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö'},
    {q:'All the joy the world contains<br/>Has come through wishing happiness for others.<br/>All the misery the world contains<br/>Has come from wanting pleasure for oneself.',a:'Shantideva'},
    {q:'To come directly into harmony with this reality<br/>just simply say when doubt arises, "Not two."<br/>In this "not two" nothing is separate,<br/>nothing is excluded.<br/>No matter when or where,<br/>enlightenment means entering this truth.<br/>And this truth is beyond extension or diminution in time or space;<br/>in it a single thought is ten thousand years.',a:'Sengcan'},
    {q:'Treat every moment <br/>as your last. <br/>It is not preparation <br/>for something else.<br/><br/>Where ever you are, <br/>you are one with the clouds <br/>and one with the sun <br/>and the stars you see.<br/><br/>You are one with everything.<br/>That is more true than I can say,<br/>and more true than you can hear.',a:'Shunryu Suzuki'},
    {q:'Whether you believe in God or not does not matter so much, whether you believe in Buddha or not does not matter so much; as a Buddhist, whether you believe in reincarnation or not does not matter so much. You must lead a good life. And a good life does not mean just good food, good clothes, good shelter. These are not sufficient. A good motivation is what is needed: compassion, without dogmatism, without complicated philosophy; just understanding that others are human brothers and sisters and respecting their rights and human dignity.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Real satisfaction does not come from having an easy life and plenty of money. These days I have a fairly comfortable life, even peace of mind, but that alone does not give me the greatest satisfaction. Real satisfaction comes when I can do something that really helps someone else without any hope of getting something in return, such as fame or a good reputation. The chance to give people something that truly benefits them does bring the greatest satisfaction.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Some people say you practice to achieve the same rank as the guru. No. You aren\'t promoted to a certain state. You have to become inseparable.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A reminder to myself<br/>In physical conduct, I will not allow myself to be rootless and hurried,<br/>Incapable of being still, carelessly following my every whim.<br/>I will always hold my own space.<br/>And be adorned by the training in pure discipline.<br/><br/>In speech, whether spiritual or secular,<br/>I will choose meaningful words<br/>And shun unconnected talk of past events<br/>Or boring discussions concerning any of the three times.<br/>I will always exert myself in dharmic recitations, proclamations, and readings.<br/><br/>In mind, I will not flutter back and forth like a young bird on a branch.<br/>Not getting absorbed in discursive thoughts of good and bad,<br/>I will meditate, cultivating forbearance and relying on my own perceptions, not those of others.<br/>I will reflect on how best to benefit the teachings and beings.',a:'16th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Westerners often seem to have a problem with self-worth. Many people say they hate themselves, or don’t like themselves. They are sure they are no good. This is probably because they don’t understand the fact of buddha nature. Understanding buddha nature is the best means of overcoming this low self-esteem, but in addition to that is the practice of emptiness. From the emptiness point of view, the person who is hated, the self, is not there. And even if disagreeable traits are there, because of emptiness it is always possible to improve. There are no permanent hateful states. Emptiness is, in a way, like the Philosopher’s Stone that Western alchemists once searched for. It is there, but not there; it is the essence of everything; it is the question and the answer to all questions. That is emptiness.',a:'Tai Situ Rinpoche'},
    {q:'As a Buddhist, especially in the Vajrayana, it\'s not your aim to fit into society. Almost the opposite. You don\'t want to fit into society. You want to be an outcast.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Life flickers in the flurries of a thousand ills, <br/>More fragile then a bubble in a stream.<br/>In sleep, each breath departs and is again drawn in;<br/>How wondrous that we wake up living still!',a:'Nagarjuna'},
    {q:'It is sometimes said that the longest journey we take is the journey from the head to the heart.',a:'Ringu Tulku'},
    {q:'The chances of finding a human existence are one in a hundred.<br/>Now that you have found one, if you fail to practise the sublime Dharma,<br/>How could you possibly expect to find such an opportunity again?<br/>This is why it’s crucial that you take advantage of your situation.',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The great masters have pointed out, that to maintain mindfulness for as long as it takes to drink a cup of tea accumulates more merit than years of practising generosity, discipline and ascetism.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'What is keeping me away from what I want to do as a practitioner? We must ask ourselves this question. Great practitioners of the past would not have the distractions that we have, however noble these aims of ours seem, because those practitioners took impermanence so deeply to heart.<br/>So we must address honestly all the attachments that keep us distracted. And if we look, with attachments there is always a sense of being bound to a burden, again, however noble. This is not about getting rid of our attachments; nor do we plan to. It\'s OK to have attachments; we all do.<br/>But as a responsible practitioner, we must look at our attachments in the context of the precious human birth, impermanence, and what we would like to accomplish as a practitioner. Then make aspirations and contemplate how we want to use the time ahead.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we face ourselves properly, fully, then we find that something exists in us that is basically awake, as opposed to asleep. We find something intrinsically cheerful and fundamentally pride-worthy. That is to say, we don’t have to con ourselves. We discover genuine one-hundred-percent gold, not even twenty-four carat. We are fundamentally awake. You might think this is just an old myth, another trick to cheer us up. But no! It is real and good.',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Look at the actual nature of harm itself: it is ungraspable. Like a drawing made on the water´s surface. When you truly experience that, resentment vanishes of its own accord. As soon as the fiery waves of thoughts subside, everything becomes like empty sky, which has nothing to gain and nothing to lose.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Appreciate and rejoice, without any expectation. It doesn’t matter if people are unkind to you, it doesn’t matter if people betray you, it doesn’t matter if people don’t even say ‘thank you’ to you; by appreciating everything around you, from happy experiences to sad, your life will become meaningful, full of understanding, joy, strength and fearlessness.',a:'Gyalwang Drukpa'},
    {q:'Your enlightenment rests on your own shoulders.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'The ultimate practice is not to consider<br/>Distractions and drowsiness as faults.<br/>Doing so to stave them off is like<br/>Kindling a lamp in bright daylight.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'Mixing the eight worldly concerns with your spiritual practice is extremely dangerous, like eating food mixed with poison. The eight worldly concerns in concise form can be reduced to two things, hope and fear, which are, in fact, desire and anger.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Do not avoid contact with suffering or close your eyes before suffering. Do not lose awareness of the existence of suffering in the life of the world. Find ways to be with those who are suffering including personal contact, visits, images and sounds.<br/>By such means, awaken yourself and others to the reality of suffering in the world.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way,<br/>nothing in the world can offend, <br/>and when a thing can no longer offend,<br/>it ceases to exist in the old way.',a:'Sengcan'},
    {q:'Hard times build determination and inner strength. Through them we can also come to appreciate the uselessness of anger. Instead of getting angry nurture a deep caring and respect for troublemakers because by creating such trying circumstances they provide us with invaluable opportunities to practice tolerance and patience.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'The teachings and practices laid out by the Buddha twenty-five hundred years ago do not in any way involve conquering problems or getting rid of the sense of loneliness, discomfort, or fear that haunts our daily lives. On the contrary, the Buddha taught that we can find our freedom only through embracing the conditions that trouble us.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Without being concentrated by a magnifying glass, dry grass can not be set alight by the rays of the sun, even though they bathe the whole earth evenly in their warmth. In the same way, it is only when focussed through the magnifying glass of your faith and devotion that the all-pervading warm rays of the buddhas’ compassion can make blessings blaze up in your being, like dry grass on fire.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we connect to others and to the planet with love and affection, our responsibility to bring about change does not have to weigh heavily on us at all. We will carry it gladly.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'If you wish to look into the mirror of mind\'s nature,<br/>Don\'t look outwards, but turn within.<br/>Looking outwards brings perpetual delusion.<br/>But look within and you\'ll see your own mind.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There are two kinds of suffering. There is the suffering you run away from, which follows you everywhere. And there is the suffering you face directly, and so become free.',a:'Ajahn Chah'},

    {q:'Toss to the winds your concern for this life, and impress on your mind the unknown time of your death. Remembering the pain of samsara, why long for the unnecessary?',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'Because we don\'t recognize our essential nature — we don’t realize that although appearances arise unceasingly, nothing is really there — we invest with solidity and reality the seeming truth of self, other, and actions between self and others. This intellectual obscuration gives rise to attachment and aversion, followed by actions and reactions that create karma, solidify into habit, and perpetuate the cycles of suffering. This entire process needs to be purified.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Every strong attachment generates an equally powerful fear that we’ll either fail to get what we want or lose whatever we’ve already gained. This fear, in the language of Buddhism, is known as aversion: a resistance to the inevitable changes that occur as a consequence of the impermanent nature of relative reality.',a: 'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Is space anywhere supported? Upon what does it rest?<br/>Like space, mahamudra is dependent upon nothing;<br/>Relax and settle in the continuum of unalloyed purity,<br/>And, your bonds loosening, release is certain.',a:'Tilopa'},
    {q:'It is often seen that human beings can endure problems quite well, but cannot endure success. When we are successful and have everything we desire, it can easily go to our heads. There is a great danger of losing our common sense and becoming careless and arrogant. As it is said, “Nothing corrupts a person more than power.” Very powerful people sometimes become so proud that they no longer care about their actions or about the effect they have on others. Losing any sense of right and wrong, they create severe problems for themselves and everyone else. Even if we have all the success we could dream of—fame, wealth, and so on—we must understand that these things have no real substance. Attachment does not come from having things, but from the way our mind reacts to them. It is fine to participate in good circumstances, provided we can see that they have no real essence. They may come and they may go. When seeing this, we will not become so attached. Even if we lose our wealth we will not be badly affected, and while it is there we will enjoy it without being senseless and arrogant.',a:'Ringu Tulku'},
    {q:'Though we\'re conditioned to identify with the thoughts that pass through our awareness rather than with awareness itself, the awareness that is our true nature is infinitely flexible. It is capable of any and every sort of experience - even misconceptions about itself as limited, trapped, ugly, anxious, lonely, or afraid. When we begin to identify with that timeless, pristine awareness rather than with the thoughts, feelings, and sensations that pass through it, we\'ve taken the first step toward facing the freedom of our true nature.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When the mind is positive, body and speech, the servants of the mind, will of course be positive also. But how are we to make the mind positive? At the moment, we cling to the notion that our minds are real entities. When someone helps us, we think, ‘That person has been so good to me. I must be kind to him in return and make him my friend for lives and lives to come.’ This only goes to show that we do not know about the empty nature of the mind. As for our enemies, we think of how to harm them as much as possible… We think like that simply because we think our anger is a true and permanent reality – while in fact it is nothing at all. We should therefore rest in the empty nature of the mind beyond all mental elaborations, in that state which is free from clinging, a clarity beyond concepts.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Whatever realization you gain from your practice of the Dharma should be valued and judged on the basis of whether your commitment to the law of karma has increased and, as a result, whether your practice of morality has become pure and whether the force of delusions, like ignorance, hatred, and desire, has decreased within you.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'In the struggle against the emotions, if you lose your vigilance even for a moment you have to revive it at once — in the same way that a swordsman in battle who lets slip his sword must pick it up again immediately. The very instant an emotion arises, the thought of using the antidote should occur to you. What else is the dharma for, if it is not to stop you giving full vent to your negative emotions?',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If your remember that awareness of whatever occurs is meditation, then meditation becomes much easier than you think.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When we look out at the world we find inconceivable suffering. Sometimes we can help others. But much of the time there is little we can do. At those times it is powerful and significant to sit quietly and just bear witness...to genuinely be there for others in this humble and silent way.',a:'Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel'},
    {q:'I have observed a strange idea of love that many people seem to have: they see love as a kind of gift that has to be given back. Someone says, “I love you,” and if the other person does not reply with an “I love you, too,” the first person gets upset. But love doesn’t always have to be reciprocated. We can just love. If love doesn’t come back to you, it is still love that you give and that you feel. We do not always have to look to get something back for what we give, do we?',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Practice in a straightforward way. There is no need to live in fantasy and \'pretend\' to be anything other than what you are. Be honest and open with yourself - if you are a good person, recognize that goodness and build upon it. If you are a deluded person, recognize that delusion and begin to disentangle yourself from it, be rid of it. It is essential that your practice be pure, straightforward and honest.<br/>Train yourself, your mind, with the meditation techniques you have received, and don\'t twist the techniques to protect your delusion.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The root of all that exists, <br/>Samsara and nirvana, is one\'s own mind. <br/>Primordially, mind is emptiness.<br/>Merge into the sky-like absolute expanse,<br/>Empty, luminous, beyond clinging.<br/>Outside, inside; eyes open or closed,<br/>Day, night; asleep or awake:<br/>No difference.<br/>During practice, after practice,<br/>Mind, appearances:<br/>Blend them.<br/>Continuously, without wavering,<br/>Merge completely with this vibrant, sky-like state.',a:'Shabkar'},
    {q:'Very different from considering the difficulties in our lives as obstacles, we can see them as opportunities. We always think that if things were exactly how we would like them to be, if people acted exactly as we would like them to act, and that if everything was perfect, then we would be happy. But happiness has nothing to do with it. Happiness has nothing to do with pleasure one after the other. Happiness is an inner state of security, knowing that we will be able to deal with whatever happens. If we are conscious and if our heart is open, if we have that inner courage and clarity we will have the ability to deal with any situation. And there will be no hope and no fear.',a:'Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'Do not allow yourself to become impervious and blasé regarding the Dharma; do not lead yourself astray. Let the profound Dharma sink into your mind. Now that you have obtained this excellent life, so hard to find, now that you have the freedom to practice the teachings, don’t waste your time.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you see that beings have fallen, just as you have, into the ocean of existence and are stumbling, unable to walk in a safe direction, because the eye of wisdom - which distinguishes what to adopt and what to discard - for them is closed, is it not better to care for others and to strive for their welfare, you who are in the Conqueror\'s lineage?... Here, you should use a great person\'s joy, charisma, and strength to shoulder the responsibility of others\' welfare, for focusing only on your own welfare is a trait shared even with the animals.',a:'Tsongkhapa'},
    {q:'When we recognize that others experience pain and unhappiness because they don’t recognize their real nature, we’re spontaneously moved by a profound wish for them to experience the same sense of peace and clarity that we’ve begun to know.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we look like Buddhists and talk like Buddhists and sit on a cushion like the other Buddhists, then we think we are automatically followers of the Buddha\'s teachings. But all these concepts are cutting us off from the utter simplicity of the Buddha\'s example and message. We do wheat we do simply to wake up, simply to be free. Any form we use is only a support of accomplishing that purpose. We could be perfect in the performance of a thousand rituals, and they could all be empty of all meaning or benefit if we don\'t connect with our heart. If we\'re not developing our awareness in our everyday life, then we\'re missing the point.',a:'Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you are not clear about the purpose of your life, you are never clear when it comes to making decisions that affect your life. You always hesitate and are always in danger of making the wrong decision. When your only purpose for living is the benefit of others, it is very easy to make the right decision. It is easy because you are very clear about why you are alive.',a:'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Anger and jealousy are related to our sense of self-centredness and our disregard for others. Self-centredness easily gives rise to fear, which fosters irritation, which, when it blazes into anger, can provoke violence. The time has come to accept that if we’re talking about peace in the world, we have to consider peace within ourselves.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'The way to change others’ minds is with affection, and not anger.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Compassion and generosity must be accompanied by detachment. Expecting something in return for them is like doing business. If the owner of a restaurant is all smiles with his customers, it is not because he loves them but because he wants to increase his turnover. When we love and help others, it should not be because we find a particular individual likeable but because we see that all beings, whether we think of them as friends or enemies, want to be happy and have the right to happiness.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Avalokiteshvara, mighty Great Treasure of Compassion,<br/>From my heart I invoke your blessing.<br/>By this blessing, may compassion be born in my mind<br/>And in the minds of all beings under the sky.<br/>If a man has compassion, he is a buddha;<br/>Without compassion, he is a Lord of Death.<br/>With compassion, the root of Dharma is planted;<br/>Without compassion, the root of Dharma is rotten.<br/>One with compassion is kind even when angry;<br/>One without compassion will kill even as he smiles.<br/>For one with compassion, even enemies will turn into friends;<br/>Without compassion, even friends turn into enemies.<br/>With compassion, one has all Dharmas;<br/>Without compassion, one has no Dharma at all.<br/>With compassion, one is a Buddhist;<br/>Without compassion, one is worse than a heretic.<br/>Even if meditating on voidness, one needs compassion as its essence.<br/>A Dharma practitioner must have a compassionate nature.<br/>Compassion is the distinctive characteristic of Buddhism.<br/>Compassion is the very essence of all Dharmas.<br/>Great compassion is like a wish-fulfilling gem.<br/>Great compassion will fulfill the hopes of self and others.<br/>Therefore, all of you, practitioners and lay people,<br/>Cultivate compassion and you will achieve buddhahood.<br/>May all men and women who hear this song<br/>With great compassion benefit all beings!',a:'Shabkar'},

    {q:'The essence of guru yoga is simply to remember the guru at all times: when you are happy, think of the guru; when you are sad, think of the guru; when you meet favorable circumstances, be grateful to the guru; and when you meet obstacles, pray to the guru, and rely on him alone. When you are sitting, think of the guru above your head. When you are walking, imagine that he is above your right shoulder, as if you were circumambulating him. When you are eating food, visualize the guru at your throat center and offer him the first portion. Whenever you wear new clothes, first offer them to the guru, and then wear them as if he had given them back to you.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Whether we and our fellow beings experience happiness or suffering, whether we have peace or violence in the world, depends entirely on the condition of our minds. The mind is what determines whether there will be happiness or suffering. Our states of mind are what makes our actions negative or positive.',a:'Trulshik Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Listen, fortunate one. Now that your spiritual connection has been forged, achieve your eternal goals. Strive on the sole path of all the victorious ones\' heirs:  Generate compassion and the mind of awakening.<br/><br/>The view is the great emptiness of samsara and enlightenment, concluding that your own awareness, the unformulated dharmakaya, is the sovereign view.<br/>Meditation is to settle unconcerned within unfabricated present awareness, unfettered by grasping.<br/>Take as the supreme kind of conduct not to fall under the negative influence of carelessness, but to have your acts accord with the Dharma.<br/><br/>Be diligent in undistracted practice.<br/><br/>I, a crazy, ragged tulku, wrote this spontaneously in response to Norbu Gyatso\'s request.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A spiritual path is only important to those who can accept the notion of the continuous manifestation of phenomena from past, present and future lives. For those unable to believe and trust this truth, to follow such a path would be pointless.<br/><br/>If there were no continuous existence, in other words if there were no such thing as reincarnation and we really did only live once; if, as many followers of new-age spirituality suggest, everyone, from a mountain yogi to a hoodie from the Bronx or an ambitious New York banker, merely became one with the elements when they died, what point would there be in practising the dharma or any other kind of spiritual path? Why bother sitting on a meditation cushion for hours on end? Why restrain yourself from indulging in all the good things the world has to offer? Why miss out on anything at all?<br/><br/>We practice the dharma so we can cut through the endless round of cyclic existence.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we\'re not too confused or hard on ourselves, we will discover the sanity beyond habitual reactions. Identifying less with habits and more with our basic nature lightens things up. With more space in our mind, we take our reactions less seriously. We can watch them the way we would watch children at play - knowing they will quickly wear themselves out.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The point is not to want to benefit anyone or make them happy. There is no audience involved, no ‘me’ and ‘them.’ It is a matter of an open gift, complete generosity without the relative notions of giving and receiving. That is the basic openness of compassion: opening without demand. Simply be what you are, be the master of the situation. If you will just ‘be’ then life flows around and through you.',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Find and work with a practice that produces a sense of calmness, clarity, confidence, and peace. If you can do that, you will benefit not only yourself, but also everyone around you.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Subconsciously we are lured by the expectation that we will reach a stage where we don’t have to fix anything ever again. One day we will reach “happily ever after.” We are convinced of the notion of “resolution.” It’s as if everything that we’ve experienced up until now, our whole lives to this moment, was a dress rehearsal. We believe our grand performance is yet to come, so we do not live for today.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We reject the deceptive appearances of cyclic existence like someone with nausea seeing food. We ache with devotion and longing for the teacher, like a small child yearning for its mother. We throw ourselves enthusiastically into study and reflection, like a thirsty person longing for water. We treasure our precepts like a poor person who has found some gold or a turquoise. We delight in practicing virtuous activities like a merchant traveling to an island of gold. Our faith and interest in all the different vehicles are like those of a keen shopper arriving at a market. It is when these signs occur that the Dharma has tamed our mind and the teachings and the individual have not gone different ways.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The sutras tell us that Mara (Buddhism’s “devil”) is a tricky character and an expert archer. To avoid straying into the sights of one of his five arrows requires tremendous effort because each one is trained on our most vulnerable spots.<br/><br/>The first of Mara’s arrows is aimed at those who feel great pride in their accomplishments or in their material or spiritual wealth.<br/><br/>The second is aimed at those who are ignorant because they have no idea which activities and attitudes need to be abandoned and which adopted.<br/><br/>The third is directed at those with wrong views, such as not believing in cause, condition and effect.<br/><br/>The fourth is fixed on those whose forgetfulness continually distracts them from mindfulness.<br/><br/>The fifth strikes those distracted by the eight worldly dharmas.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Untainted by forced, conceptual meditation, <br/>Unmoved by the winds of mundane distractions, <br/>Knowing how to rest naturally and uncontrived in our basic nature, <br/>May we master maintaining the experience of the nature of mind.',a:'Rangjung Dorje, the Third Karmapa'},
    {q:'Why do we need dualistic practices, such as generating merit, to reach a state that transcends duality? Because we have to start from where we are. Our mind’s true nature is covered by karmic turbulence caused by our grasping at self and our negative mental habits. “Grasping at a self” refers to the way we grasp at mental objects as truly existing, perceiving them dualistically as subject and object. The aspect of our mind that perceives this way is conceptual mind. Conceptual mind and the true nature of mind are like the surface and depths of the ocean: The surface is choppy with wind-tossed waves; beneath it is still and peaceful.<br/><br/>Most of us can’t glimpse into the depths, our true nature, because our conceptual mind is constantly churning out turbulence. Grasping at self tricks us, like a nightmare, into believing that we are separate from the world and each other. This triggers negative emotions, from craving and anxiety to jealousy and aggression, which spill out into unhealthy words and actions.<br/><br/>Every dualistic perception, every negative thought, feeling, word, and deed, leaves a negative karmic imprint in our conceptual mind that walls us off from our true nature. On the other hand, positive mentalities leave positive karmic imprints that open our mind, loosen grasping at self, and thin out the barriers to our true nature.<br/><br/>As long as we have dualistic concepts and emotions, the world is solid to us. Our suffering is all too real. Circumstances matter. If our surroundings are chaotic, it will be hard to find tranquillity. If we experience peace and joy, however, we will be inspired to generate even more peace and joy. Then whatever we say and do will be the words and deeds of joy and peace. We progressively loosen our grasping at self, and eventually we glimpse the luminous nature of our mind. If we perfect this realization, we uproot grasping at self and become fully awakened.',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'Love means wishing for the happiness of others.<br/>Like a loving mother cherishing her child,<br/>One\'s body, wealth and virtue all amassed one gives for others\' benefit,<br/>While training to endure the harms that they inflict.',a:'Jigme Lingpa'},
    {q:'Someone asked me recently if I am afraid to die. Truthfully, I am more afraid of not living my life fully — of living a life dedicated to cherishing and protecting myself. This fear-driven approach to life is like covering your couch in plastic so it won\'t get worn. It robs you of the ability to enjoy and appreciate your life. It takes courage to accept life fully, to say yes to our life, yes to our karma, yes to our mind, emotions and whatever else unfolds. This is the beginning of courage. Courage is the fundamental openness to face even the hardest truths. It makes room for all the pain, joy, irony, and mystery that life provides.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Cause is not before and effect is not after.',a:'Dogen Zenji'},
    {q:'The attitude and intention for embracing any Dharma needs to be a real and deep-rooted one, not an emotional one. Many people with fleeting emotions think that they have the required mindset, but they haven\'t, and they also have immediate expectations for some great results. But if you practise Dharma with such an idea of worldly reward or achievement, then that is not the real practice of Dharma. Practicing Dharma needs a long-term determination to practice continuously in this and all the coming lifetimes. So I think that has not matured in the minds of many new Western Buddhist practitioners, and due to this short-term expectation and day-by-day evaluation, which hardly shows swift progress, one day you will find yourself frustrated and give up the practice. So before entering into the practise, you must have a deep understanding and study, and then examine yourself, whether you are able to endure it on a sustainable basis and only then should you get into the practice of Dharma. Otherwise it will become a kind of child\'s play and that may be no good for anyone.',a:'Samdhong Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The true bodhisattva spirit grows out of this personal sense of freedom. You discover that you don\'t feel so needy anymore. You don\'t crave another refueling - with shamatha or with other people\'s love and attention - because you know within yourself how to be free, how to be confident. With this sense of security and freedom, you begin to direct your attention to the needs of others. The compassion expands. This is my point about inner simplicity as the basis for living fearlessly in a complex world.<br/><br/>This principle of fearless simplicity involves training in the two accumulations as a unity and experiencing the fruition of such training. We have found a true, effective remedy for ego-clinging, negative emotions, the twofold ignorance, and adversity. We have persevered in the two accumulations, and we have grown confident in liberation. We are now open and spacious, and from within that sense of fearless simplicity, we can accomadate all phenomena. We can naturally care for others unpretentiously; no one is a threat any longer.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If kindness doesn\'t work, try more kindness.',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Having this precious human life is like having a well-rigged ship on which to sail across the ocean to an island of treasures. As Shantideva says in The way of the Bodhisattva:<br/>Cross the sea of emotions<br/>On the boat of human existence.<br/>You have not obtained this precious human existence just by chance. It is the result of having heard the buddha\'s name in a past life, having taken refuge in him, accumulated virtuous actions, and of having developed some wisdom. There is no certainty that you will obtain this vessel again.<br/>If you fail to practice the Dharma in this life, it is certain that you will not obtain a human existence in the next life. To neglect such an opportunity would therefore be very foolish. Do not waste it. Practice day and night.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We do not have control over the arising of discursive thoughts. Discursive thoughts do not arise according to a schedule; they can and do arise at any time whatsoever. Exactly in accordance with that, meditation needs to be something which can and does arise at any time whatsoever. In other words, given that the arising of discursive thoughts is unscheduled, to have meditation which is liberating we need a meditation in which the arising of discursive thoughts comes together with the meditation, and the meditation comes together with the arising of discursive thoughts.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'At present we perceive samsara as something we have to reject and nirvana as something we have to attain. Now while this is correct according to relative truth, according to absolute truth the nature of the afflictive emotions and actions that we are supposed to reject is nothing other than emptiness. When we realize the dharmakaya, which is free from true existence, we will know that all perceptions are similar to a dream or an illusion and we will no longer crave these phenomena. As it is said, \'While there is attachment, there is no view.\' And the absence of attachment is the supreme view.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The great Jigme Lingpa said that when a yogi pursues the path of enlightenment, he could spend years and years accumulating merit through all kinds of methods, but meditation that lasts the duration of a cup of tea is more penetrating to this solid hard wrapping of ours. Spending years and years in meditation is excellent, but it is nothing compared to a single moment of remembering the guru. Even just remembering the guru\'s name will dispel confusion and accumulate countless oceans of merit.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Every one of us has been hurt by people we have cared for, and although we may insist we have forgotten all about it, we rarely have. To help ease any lingering pain, visualise them in the place of honour, and as you arouse bodhicitta, wish them everything that is good. If thinking about them continues to be painful, it is a sign that you have not let go of feeling they have wronged you. Try not to focus on it. Instead, admit to yourself that you are still holding on to your pain. Then concentrate on wishing them every happiness and long to take all their sufferings on yourself. And do bear in mind that for those who are really serious about practicing the dharma, difficult relationships provide the most fertile ground for practice.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Always recognize the dreamlike qualities of life and reduce attachment and aversion. Practice good-heartedness toward all beings. Be loving and compassionate, no matter what others do to you. What they will do will not matter so much when you see it as a dream. The trick is to have positive intention during the dream. This is the essential point. This is true spirituality.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If a person can really relate to the simplicity of the practice of meditation, then automatically there is an absence of aggression. Because there is no rush to achieve, you can afford to relax. Because you can afford to relax, you can afford to keep company with yourself, be friends with yourself. Then thoughts, emotions, whatever occurs in the mind, constantly accentuate the act of making friends with yourself.',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You need to let go of yourself when you are practicing compassion. Trying to practice compassion while remaining absorbed with yourself is going to exhaust you, you\'re going to feel very tired, you\'re going to feel that you can\'t change anything, that you aren\'t helping enough, you think you need to do something good and then feel guilty about not doing enough. If you are filled with worry, with fear, that is not actually compassion. We become exhausted by our ideas, but genuine compassion is bigger than our ideas, it\'s stronger, it has no exhaustion. Compassion does not drain you. What really drains you is when you try to practice compassion while being absorbed with yourself. Check for yourself, look at yourself. Don\'t believe me. Experiment with yourself and see if it is true.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Above all, don’t wish to become a future Buddha;<br/>Your only concern should be,<br/>As thought follows thought,<br/>To avoid clinging to any of them.',a:'Dogen Zenji'},
    {q:'Although the spiritual journey is a homecoming of sorts, it is still indispensable to proceed on the path in the first place. We cannot say that since our authentic state is the enlightened mind of luminous bliss, we need not embark on any kind of spiritual journey. We cannot afford to think we are already there. Although our original state of being is the same as that of the buddhas, we are not buddhas yet. We are deluded sentient beings, and our minds are layered with defilements and obscurations. In fact, due to the density of our obscurations, we are not even in a condition to catch the occasional glimpse of our original condition. There should be no doubt that we categorically need to engage in some kind of spiritual practice, one that is genuine and effective and can be systematically utilized to illuminate the darkness of our ignorance.',a:'Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is our motivation that directs our acts, just as an irrigation channel makes water flow where it is wanted. If our acts are constantly inspired by the desire to relieve others of their suffering, in the end this desire will be fulfilled. But if we ignore this great ideal, and instead limit ourselves to achieving a long comfortable, and prosperous life, we may well get it – but certainly nothing more. It is essential not to devote our lives to vain or unimportant goals.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Buddhism tells us to become a Buddha. That\'s very nice and also a very long shot. We don\'t have to deny that we want to become Buddha. That is fine. It is the traditional teaching and the Mahayana tells us that this is the purpose and goal. Fine. But we have to bite what we can chew. If we keep on biting for enlightenment we may get nowhere. I remember when I was a kid, I got this big rock sugar and tried to bite the whole thing and got nothing, except a little bit. So bite only what you can chew. Then it has nice taste, is sweet, juicy and it helps and it is great. The spiritual practice is also like that. Yes, the ultimate goal is to become Buddha. That will be fine. Leave it there. Temporarily you have to make yourself better - today. Really, it is important today. Today is very important. You have to make yourself better today and tomorrow. So every day we have to look in that way. That is our goal - to make one day better. Take it day by day and sometimes hour by hour. I keep on talking that we have to do something to make ourselves better. It is almost like talking about change without saying what to change.<br/><br/>What is there to do? Three things, remember: Morality, concentration and wisdom. Combine them together in everyday life and it doesn\'t have to be the perfect wisdom of emptiness. Wisdom, whatever you can manage, put that wisdom in your daily life. Keep your morality, whatever you can manage, in your life. Focus whatever you can focus and make it the best. That\'s how we spend our life. Make your life better day by day. When you do that you will see different results within you. That\'s what you need. That\'s something we can chew, so what\'s what we can bite.',a:'Gelek Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Sometime go outside and sit,<br/>In the evening at sunset,<br/>When there’s a slight breeze that touches your body,<br/>And makes the leaves and the trees move gently.<br/>You’re not trying to do anything, really.<br/>You’re simply allowing yourself to be,<br/>Very open from deep within,<br/>Without holding onto anything whatsoever.<br/>Don’t bring something back from the past, from a memory.<br/>Don’t plan that something should happen.<br/>Don’t hold onto anything in the present.<br/>Nothing you perceive needs to be nailed down.<br/>Simply let experience take place, very freely,<br/>So that your empty, open heart<br/>Is suffused with the tenderness of true compassion.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you don’t try to stop whatever is going on in your mind, but merely observe it, eventually you’ll begin to feel a tremendous sense of relaxation, a vast sense of openness within your mind – which is in fact your natural mind, the naturally unperturbed background against which various thoughts come and go.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The great Longchenpa said, when the moon rises and when there is a clear lake, even though you may not wish it, the moon is reflected in the lake. Likewise, as long as sentient beings have merit, the image of the Buddha and his teachings and his blessing are reflected, even though you don\'t search for them. But if the lake is murky and defiled and not clear, even though the moon is shining in the clear sky, the reflection of the moon doesn\'t exist.<br/><br/>Likewise, even though the compassion of the Buddha is infinite and ever-present, if there is no merit among sentient beings for the Buddhas to reflect, then the chance of communication with the Buddha probably does not exist. However, judging not just from us, but from everything that is going on regarding the activity of the Dharma, I feel that we sentient beings still have a lot of merit.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'People with a misconception about meditation believe that all thoughts should cease. We cannot, in fact, establish ourselves in a state devoid of thoughts. The fruit of meditation is not the absence of thoughts, but the fact that thoughts cease to harm us. Once enemies, they become friends.',a:'Bokar Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Such is the strength of delusion and habitual tendencies that practicing Dharma might initially seem very hard; but these difficulties will gradually subside. Once you have understood the essential point of the teachings, you will experience no hardship or difficulty with the practice. Your efforts will bring you joy. It is like developing any skill - as you master the important points, it becomes progressively easier, you gain increasing confidence, and your capacity and endeavor keep on growing.<br/><br/>Whatever meditation or reflection you have done, it will never be wasted. The benefit it brings will be present in your mindstream at the time of your death, and will help you be reborn in a place where the Dharma flourishes, near an authentic spiritual teacher. Life after life, you will evolve from a mediocre into an average practitioner into an excellent one. The essence of learning is reflection, and the essence of reflection is meditation. As you go deeper into the meaning of the teachings, the wondrous qualities of the Dharma will become ever clearer, like the sun appearing ever brighter the higher you fly.<br/><br/>The sign that you have fully assimilated your learning of the Dharma is that you become peaceful by nature. The sign that you have assimilated your meditation is that you are free of obscuring emotions. As learning leads to reflection and reflection transforms into meditation, your eagerness for the deluded activities of this life will relax, and you will yearn for the Dharma instead.<br/><br/>Anything you do that is in accord with the Dharma, however small or trivial it may seem, will be beneficial.

    {q:'All difficulties come from not thinking of others. Whatever you are doing, look constantly into the mirror of your mind and check whether your motive is for yourself or for others. Gradually you will develop the ability to master your mind in all circumstances; and by following in the footsteps of the accomplished masters of the past, you will gain enlightenment in a single lifetime. A good mind is like a rich ground of gleaming gold, lighting up the whole sky with its golden radiance. But if body, speech, and mind are not tamed, there is very little chance that you will achieve any realization whatsoever. Be aware of your thoughts, words, and actions at all times. If they take the wrong direction, your study and practice of the Dharma will be of no use.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

If you remember that awareness of what occurs is meditation, then meditation becomes much easier than you may think.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Once you taste the peace, joy and serenity that result from the practice of slow mindful walking - you can practice walking meditation wherever you are.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'A little bit of salt can make a small amount of water taste salty, but can not change a huge river like the Ganges. In the same way, even a small negative action can harm someone whose positive actions are weak, but can not harm someone who has frequently performed immensely positive actions vast in scope. Therefore, we should try to perform powerful positive actions repeatedly on a vast scale.',a:'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The alternation of thoughts of happiness and suffering, desire and aversion, is nothing more than the play of mind\'s luminous emptiness. Without altering whatever arises, look at mind\'s nature, and you will perceive it as great bliss.',a:'Minling Terchen Gyurme Dorje'},
    {q:'The wind blows through the sky and flies over continents without settling anywhere. It traverses space and leaves no trace. Thus should thoughts pass through our minds, leaving no karmic residues and not altering our realization of fundamental simplicity. ',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Our perceptions and thinking process are very limited. We see our world as something huge, and we think it is permanent and stable, indestructible like a diamond, immovable like a great mountain. But in fact this way of thinking is only our concepts about it.<br/><br/>In order to understand the emptiness of the phenomena to which we are so attached, we need to have a vast, open mind.',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Do not allow yourself to become impervious and blasé regarding the Dharma. Do not lead yourself astray. Let the profound Dharma sink into your mind. Now that you have obtained this excellent life, so hard to find, now that you have the freedom to practice the teachings, do not waste your time.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'As long as you accept and practice these four truths (all compounded things are impermanent, all emotions are pain, all things have no inherent existence, nirvana is beyond concepts) you are a “practicing Buddhist.” You might read about these four truths for the sake of entertainment or mental exercise, but if you don’t practice them, you are like a sick person reading the label on a medicine bottle but never taking the medicine. On the other hand, if you are practicing, there is no need to exhibit that you are Buddhist. As a matter of fact, if it helps you to get invited to some social functions, it is totally fine to hide that you are a Buddhist. But keep in mind that as a Buddhist, you have a mission to refrain as much as possible from harming others, and to help others as much as possible. This is not a huge responsibility, because if you genuinely accept and contemplate the truths, all these deeds flow naturally.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse  Rinpoche'},
    {q:'People who lack faith are deprived of the good fortune of being able to practice the Dharma, and their not having faith is therefore an immeasurable defect. Just as a rock on the bottom of the ocean will never appear on the surface, without faith it is impossible to reach the dry land of liberation. Just as a ferry without a helmsman will never reach the other shore, without faith it is impossible to traverse the great river of suffering. Without faith, it is as impossible to nurture good qualities in one’s being as it is for someone with no hands to pick up anything even if he were to find himself on an island of gold. Without faith, it is impossible for the shoot of bodhichitta to grow, for nothing can ever sprout from a burned seed. Without faith, one is like a blind person who finds himself in a temple: it is impossible to see the light of the Dharma. Without faith, however clever one is, one is trapped in the deep pit of cyclic existence: everything one does becomes an action that leads to cyclic existence, and it is impossible to ever attain the freedom of enlightenment. As the Sutra of the Ten Qualities puts it, From roasted seeds No greenery will sprout. In those who have no faith No virtue will appear.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Compassion must start with seeing our own suffering. If it does not, then seeing the suffering of others will be merely conceptual. It will merely be a matter of having learned about suffering from a book or philosophy. We may intellectually know about the different types of suffering and so forth, but without inward reflection, our understanding will always be a theoretical knowledge that is directed toward the outside. Starting from our own experience of suffering becomes most important for the practice of open and genuine compassion.',a:'Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The very purpose of religion is to control yourself, not to criticize others. Rather, we must criticize ourselves. How much am I doing about my anger? About my attachment, about my hatred, about my pride, my jealousy? These are the things which we must check in daily life.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Because of faith, one does not engage in negative activities, and one performs the activities praised by the sublime beings. Train in each of the above so that your devotion increases daily.',a:'Sutra of the Inconceivable Secrets'},
    {q:'All sentient beings are the same in wishing to be happy and not to suffer. The great difference between oneself and others is in numbers—there is only one of me, but countless others. So, my happiness and my suffering are completely insignificant compared to the happiness and suffering of infinite other beings. What truly matters is whether other beings are happy or suffering. This is the basis of bodhichitta. We should wish others to be happy rather than ourselves, and we should especially wish happiness for those whom we perceive as enemies and those who treat us badly. Otherwise, what is the use of compassion?',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'As soon as you see something,<br/>you already start to intellectualize it.<br/>As soon as you intellectualize something,<br/>it is no longer what you saw.',a:'Shunryu Suzuki'},
    {q:'If we really want to be sublime meditators, we should not set a time period for our meditation, as it is the modern meditator\'s style. We should not count the hours or minutes because limited time makes limited meditation. Our ordering, limited gross and subtle elements\' mind cannot release itself into the sublime, limitless, secret essence of the elements if we are bound by exact time. If our mind is bound by anything, it is never vast. If we are trapped and limited by time, place and direction, how can we have Wisdom Mind confidence? How can we understand other people’s faculties and benefit other beings? How can we help limited mind with limited meditation mind.',a:'Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Every time you practice walking meditation, investing your mind and body in every step, you are taking your situation in hand. Every time you breathe in and know you are breathing in, every time you breathe out and smile to your out-breath, you are yourself. You are your own master; you are the gardener in your own garden. We are relying on you to take good care of your garden, so that you can help your beloved to take care of hers.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'Theoretical knowledge has no end. Take to heart and practice what you have learned.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We should also avoid thinking of ourselves as worthless persons – we are naturally free and unconditioned. We are intrinsically enlightened and lack nothing. When engaging in meditation practice, we should feel it to be as natural as eating, breathing and defecating. It should not become a specialized or formal event, bloated with seriousness and solemnity.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In the garden of gentle sanity, may you be bombarded by coconuts of wakefulness',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Being content with fewer desires is the greatest asset that one can have. Those who are able to maintain such a disposition are truly rich people even if they do not own a single asset, because only they can attain the ultimate, perfect happiness.',a:'Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro'},
    {q:'Samsara is an expression of nirvana, just as relative reality is an expression of absolute reality.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Ordinary enjoyments are pleasurable in the beginning, but as time goes on, they become an increasing source of torment, If you wrap a strip of wet leather around your wrist, it is fine at first, but as the leather dries and shrinks, it tightens painfully. What a relief it is to cut it away with a knife!...<br/><br/>Once you have understood the union of emptiness and the dependent arising of phenomena, you will see clearly how deluded and deceiving the ways of the world really are, and, like an old man forced to play children’s games, you will find them very tiresome. When you realised the utter foolishness of spending your life attached to friends and scheming to subdue your enemies and competitors, you will find it tedious.<br/><br/>Once you have been struck by the pointlessness of letting yourself be forever influenced and conditioned by your habitual tendencies, you will become sick of it... That will inspire you to strive towards liberation – and by striving for it, you will attain it. Samsara will never just disappear on its own. You have to want to get rid of it actively yourself.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Recognizing your faults without judging yourself is called wisdom my dears.<br/>Being hard on yourself, and feeling like a loser is called wasting your time with ego my dears.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The realization that all phenomena of samsara and enlightenment are emptiness inseparable from naked awareness is the view. To release present awareness within the spacious natural state and then to sustain the self-liberation of thoughts without grasping is meditation. All post-meditative activity done harmoniously with the Dharma is the conduct. The complete manifestation of that abiding nature is the result.<br/><br/>I, Vajra Jnana, wrote this in response to the nun Jampa Chodron.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Some people consider the practice of love and compassion is only related to religious practice and if they are not interested in religion they neglect these inner values. But love and compassion are qualities that human beings require just to live together.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Even though emptiness is hard to grasp, it is also “knowing one that frees all.”<br/><br/>“Knowing one,” meaning once your wisdom-door is wide open, you are able to open hundreds of other doors, every single other door.<br/><br/>Please pay special attention to this key point of knowing one that liberates everything!',a:'Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In the monastery of your heart and body,<br/>you have a temple where all buddhas unite.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'And as for the beings who inhabit this world, there has never been a single one who was born that did not die. So death will certainly come to you too, and there is no guarantee that it will not come tonight.<br/><br/>At the time of your death, nothing but the completely pure Dharma will be of any benefit; and once you have died, your future will be determined solely by your past actions...<br/><br/>...Recognizing that the Dharma alone will benefit you at the moment of death and in the future, practice it as much as possible in the course of every single day.',a:'Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo'},
    {q:'In the struggle against the emotions, if you lose your vigilance even for a moment you have to revive it at once, in the same way that a swordsman in battle who drops his sword must pick it up again immediately. The very instant an emotion arises, the thought of using the antidote should occur to you.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Motivation is the single most important factor in determining whether your experience is conditioned by suffering or by peace.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'From the very first step on the path right now, all the way until you have reached the final end, it is of vital importance to rely on someone who is better than yourself. This is in order to direct your mind towards the spiritual practice of past masters and to raise your own level of experience and realisation.<br/>Those who begin by being content and knowing "just this much" and cling to it, whatever insight it may be, will never reach the end of the path, even if they practice in solitude, and will therefore not notice any sidetrack or delusion. Other people may see you as a spiritual person, but for you personally there will be no progress.',a:'Longchenpa'},
    {q:'If you are not content with just a few possessions, for as long as one desire after another arises, the deceptive demon of pleasure will easily enter.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Awareness in itself is always clear, capable of reflecting anything, even misconceptions about itself.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Try sitting alone in a house and doing absolutely nothing. Sooner or later your hands will reach for the remote control or the newspaper. We need to be occupied. We need to be busy. If we are not busy, we feel insecure.<br/>But there is something very strange in all this. The ego searches constantly for distraction, and then the distraction itself becomes a problem. Instead of helping us to feel reassured, it actually increases our insecurity. We get obsessed with the distraction and it develops into another habit. Once it becomes a habit, it is difficult to get rid of. So in order to get rid of this new habit, we have to adopt yet another habit. This is how things go on and on.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you practice sitting meditation in the temple and you hear bombs and the cry of victims outside, you have to go out and help. You have to do the kind of work that will bring relief for the people around, because to meditate is to be aware of what is going on in yourself and around you.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'Of the view, meditation and action, view is most important.<br/>It\'s crucial that you realize the view without error,<br/>For unless you realize the view, meditation will have no basis.<br/>So you must realize the view directly, with no confusion.<br/>And then, when taking this to heart through meditation,<br/>To abide in the experience of the view that you have recognized,<br/>For longer and longer periods, through perseverance, is meditation.<br/>Other than this, there\'s nothing else on which to meditate.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Our fundamental nature is intrinsic. No sane, intelligent human being is impeded from being in touch with this basic nature. There is no one standing between you and it, no one is appearing like a mara to perform dances of distraction. At any given moment, each one of you — even with no understanding of Buddhism — has the natural potential to realize you are completely and inseparably united with your intrinsic wisdom nature. You have never been separate from it for a moment. It is not a sometimes-there-sometimes-not quality or an adornment that’s been attached or added on to you.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you merely talk about the view of emptiness but at the same time behave inconsiderately, it is said that your conduct has become lost in the view. If you believe that, since everything is empty by nature, it is all right to do whatever you want and it makes no difference whether your actions are virtuous or non-virtuous, then your conduct has become “lost in the view.” All the great teachers say just the opposite—that the more you understand the view of emptiness, the more aware and careful you are regarding the law of cause and effect.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Done right, discipline is taken on joyfully and with a clear understanding of why engaging in it is good. For example, many people nowadays have given up eating meat. Why would we do that? We should not become vegetarian just because someone says we should, or because the Buddha taught that we should not eat meat, or because it is the custom where we live, or because giving up meat would give us a good reputation. If we give up eating meat for these reasons, it might be better not to do it at all, because our decision is not sincerely motivated.<br/>In the beginning, we have a certain feeling about not eating meat. Then we can ask ourselves questions, such as what are the real benefits? After careful consideration, we become certain that this is the right thing to do. Our answer has to come from within, inspired by real conviction, so that when we do give up eating meat, it does not become a hardship or a struggle but something we do with joy and intelligence. It is the same with any discipline in the Vinaya, the Mahayana, or the Vajrayana. Whatever we give up or whatever we do, we should first feel a connection to the practice and then be very clear why we are doing this and not something else. When we act this way, our discipline becomes very inspiring.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'What is the difference between the real state of rigpa and the imitation? Check whether or not there is any clinging, any sense of keeping hold of something. With conceptual rigpa you notice a sense of trying to keep a state, trying to maintain a state, trying to nurture a state. There is a sense of hope or fear and also a sense of being occupied. Understand? The keeping means there’s a sense of protecting, of not wanting to lose it, in the back of the mind. This is not bad, it’s good, and for some people there’s no way around training like that in the beginning. Through training in this way, that conceptual aspect becomes increasingly refined and clarified.<br/><br/>So you practice more, more, more. Now you have more of a sense of openness, but still you’re holding this openness. All right, then, let the openness go. Let’s say that after two months you let it go. But still you’re staying within the openness — so then you practice letting go of the staying. And somehow there is still a remnant of wanting to achieve it again. So you let that go as well, and slowly again let it go, let it go, until you become very much “just there,” and finally very free and easy.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The poisonous emotions that saturate people’s minds in this dark era are the principal cause of their wandering in the endless cycle of samsara. To deal with those emotions we need to keep a constant vigilance, following the example of the Kadampa masters, who used to say:<br/><br/>I will hold the spear of mindfulness at the gate of the mind,<br/>And when the emotions threaten,<br/>I, too, will threaten them.<br/>When they relax their grip, only then will I relax mine.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you are young and vigorous<br/>You never think of old age coming,<br/>But it approaches slow and sure<br/>Like a seed growing underground.<br/>When you are strong and healthy<br/>You never think of sickness coming,<br/>But it descends with sudden force<br/>Like a stroke of lightning.<br/>When involved in worldly things<br/>You never think of death’s approach.<br/>Quick it comes like thunder<br/>Crashing round your head.<br/>Sickness, old age and death<br/>Ever meet each other<br/>As do hands and mouth.<br/>Waiting for his prey in ambush,<br/>Yama is ready for his victim,<br/>When disaster catches him.<br/>Sparrows fly in single file.

    {q:'Looking outwards will bring continual delusion for your mind.<br/>But looking within, you will experience its nature.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is different to respond to suffering with love than to react with "rightness," even when we encounter great pain and violence. Check your mind to see the difference. "Rightness" is divisive and full of aggression. The world is in turmoil because of rightness. Rather than being right we can ask a question, for instance: "What can be done in this situation to benefit both self and other?" "What serves?"<br/>There is no rightness here...but there is care and openness. Care and openness are quite functional. "Rightness" doesn\'t seem to serve us well. This is what I mean when I speak of the limits of "answers."',a:'Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel'},
    {q:'There are, in fact, no good thoughts or bad thoughts. There are only thoughts.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We do so much, we run so quickly, the situation is difficult, and many people say, "Don\'t just sit there, do something." But doing more things may make the situation worse. So you should say, "Don\'t just do something, sit there." Sit there, stop, be yourself first, and begin from there.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'Renunciation mind is very simple in a way: we have renunciation mind when we realise that all this is not a big deal. Somebody steps on your toe – what’s the big deal? The more we get used to this notion, the more we have renunciation mind. Renunciation somehow has this connotation of giving something up. But it is like the example of the mirage. You can’t give up the water because there is none; it is only a mirage. Moreover, you don’t have to give up a mirage, because what is the point of giving up a mirage? One need simply know that it is a mirage. Such understanding is a big renunciation. The moment you know that it is a mirage, most likely you will not even go there because you know it is fake. Or even if you do go, there is no disappointment because you already know what is there. At the very least you will only have a little disappointment.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Here are some signs that your workplace is not working for women:<br/>Women have to pump milk in the bathroom because you’ve made room for a ping-pong table but not for a private corner for new mothers.<br/>The only way you have to bond with teams is drunken parties.',a:'Ribur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We often think the only way to create happiness is to try to control the outer circumstances of our lives, to try to fix what seems wrong or to get rid of everything that bothers us. But the real problem lies in our reaction to those circumstances. What we have to change is the mind and the way it experiences reality.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'However beautiful a song may be,<br/>it is just a tune to those<br/>who do not understand its meaning.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'You may wonder if the most wonderful moments of your life are already behind you. Or you may think the happiest moment of your life is still to come. But this is the moment we have been waiting for. The Buddha said, “You have to make the present moment into the most wonderful moment of your life.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'When you pray, it might be to an image of the Buddha or your teacher. or you could pray to the nature of your own mind, as inseparable from the nature of the deity. Sometimes you might not even know to whom you are praying, but the asking itself has its own power. In fact, if you think about it, do you really have to know? And can you? The nature of the Buddha, the teacher, or anything in this world is fathomless, mysterious and doesn’t lend itself to being known in a conclusive way.',a:'Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel'},
    {q:'Keep in mind the many beings who are suffering in the same way as you are, and pray that your suffering may absorb theirs and that they may be liberated from all suffering. In this way, illness can teach us compassion.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We say, “I take refuge in sangha,” but sangha is made of individual practitioners. So you have to take care of yourself. Otherwise you don’t have much to contribute to the community because you do not have enough calm, peace, solidity, and freedom in your heart. That is why in order to build a community, you have to build yourself at the same time. The community is in you and you are in the community. You interpenetrate each other. That is why I emphasize sangha-building. That doesn’t mean that you neglect your own practice. It is by taking good care of your breath, of your body, of your feelings, that you can build a good community.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},

    {q:'The opportunity to experience yourself differently is always available.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you chase after thoughts and emotions, if you let them lead you, they begin to define you, and you lose your ability to respond openly and spontaneously in the present moment. On the other hand, if you attempt to block your thoughts, your mind can become quite tight and small.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},

    {q:'When we engage in the practice of discovering space, we should develop the feeling of opening ourselves out completely to the entire universe. We should open ourselves with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind. This is the powerful and ordinary practice of dropping the mask of self-protection.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Buddhahood is something that is already present, it has always been there. The result of the five paths is simply the recognition of the buddha nature that we already have. Once we recognize this fundamental nature, there is no need to look for any extra, separate qualities associated with the result, enlightenment – just as when we see the sun, we do not have to look for its rays. So do not feel that enlightenment is something far, far away that you might obtain in the distant future and that your present condition is different. The nature of mind is the Buddha at this very moment, so there is no need to wonder hopefully, “How can I obtain this result?”<br/>Nothing that you perceive, suffering or bliss, afflictive emotions or primal wisdom, is extraneous to your own mind, so<br/><br/>Do not regard anything as a defect.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'My teachers described the clear light of mind as self-illuminating – like the flame of a candle, which is both a source of illumination and illumination itself. Clarity is part of the mind from the beginning, a natural awareness. You can’t develop it the way, for instance, you develop muscles through physical exercise. The only thing you have to do is acknowledge it, simply notice the fact that you’re aware.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It’s like a dance. And we have to give each being space to dance their dance. Everything is dancing; even the molecules inside the cells are dancing. But we make our lives so heavy. We have these incredibly heavy burdens we carry with us like rocks in a big rucksack. We think that carrying this big heavy rucksack is our security; we think it grounds us. We don’t realize the freedom, the lightness of just dropping it off, letting it go. That doesn’t mean giving up relationships; it doesn’t mean giving up one’s profession, or one’s family,or one’s home. It has nothing to do with that; it’s not an external change. It’s an internal change. It’s a change from holding on tightly to holding very lightly.',a:'Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'Sentient beings are limitless. Therefore if we cultivate bodhicitta by relying on the understanding that there are limitless sentient beings, our cultivation of bodhicitta becomes limitless too. The authentic cultivation of limitless bodhicitta is accomplished that way. <br/><br/>Then if our cultivation of bodhicitta is limitless, it goes without saying that the benefits would be limitless too. But the problem is that we do not fully understand that sentient beings really are limitless.<br/><br/>We may talk about "all old-mother-like sentient beings who are equal to space", but nobody seems to fully understand just how vast the universe actually is. And no one seems to know that it is pervaded by sentient beings. Some scientists even say that there are no inhabited worlds except planet earth. But such a perspective is too narrow! It is like only seeing the eye of a needle!',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},

    {q:'We begin this journey with a good heart, with the intention to benefit all sentient beings. This is the first and most important step on the journey.

    {q:'So as a meditator, as a practitioner, somehow, even if you have a family, even if you have a job, even if you have a business, and even if you have lots of plans for your life, that is alright, you are not a hundred percent yogi, but you are a yogi in the making, so stop and minimize anything that will make you get lost and wander. That way your time and energy, everything will be efficient and will be focused towards your goal, your samsaric goal as well as your dharma goal – your dharma goal and samsaric goal should be complementary. Your samsaric goal cannot be one way and your dharma goal another way; they can be a support to each other. If you want to be in samsara and try to practice dharma, then slowly, maybe in this life, you can be a yogi, but if not, then the next life. Anyway, this way you really will achieve something in this life, as far as your dharma practice is concerned.',a:'Tai Situ Rinpoche'},
    {q:'During meditation one\'s mind, being evenly settled in its own natural way, is like still water, unruffled by ripple or breeze, and as any thought or change arises in that stillness it forms, like a wave in the ocean, and disappears back into it again. Left naturally, it dissolves; naturally. Whatever turbulence of mind erupts- if you let it be, it will of its own course play itself out, liberate itself; and thus the view arrived at through meditation is that whatever appears is none other than the self display or projection of the mind. <br/><br/>In continuing the perspective of this view into the activities and events of everyday life, the grasp of dualistic perception of the world as solid, fixed and tangible reality (which is <br/>the root cause of our problems) begins to loosen and dissolves. Mind is like the wind. It comes and goes; and through increasing certainty in this view one begins to appreciate <br/>the humor of the situation. Things start to feel somewhat unreal, and the attachment and importance which one signifies to events begin to seem ridiculous, or at any rate <br/>lighthearted. <br/><br/>Thus one develops the ability to dissolve perception by continuing the flowing awareness of meditation into everyday life, seeing everything as the self-manifest play of the mind. <br/>And immediately after sitting meditation, the continuation of this awareness is helped by doing what you have to do calmly and quietly, with simplicity and without agitation. <br/><br/>So in a sense everything is like a dream, illusory, but even so humorously one goes on doing things. If you are walking, for instance, without unnecessary solemnity or self-consciousness, but lightheartedly walk towards the open space of suchness, truth. When you eat, be the stronghold of truth, what is. As you eat, feed the negativities and illusions into the belly of emptiness, dissolving them into space; and when you are pissing consider all your obscurations and blockages are being cleansed and washed away. <br/><br/>So far I have told you the essence of the practice in a nutshell, but you must realize that as long as we continue to see the world in a dualistic way, until we are really free of attachment and negativity, and have dissolved all our outer perceptions into the purity of the empty nature of mind, we are still stuck in the relative world of good and bad, positive and negative actions, and we must respect these laws and be mindful and responsible for our actions.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},

    {q:'When we see and acknowledge our own faults, it means that the ego is not in charge.

    {q:'This variety of desirous and hateful thoughts<br/>That strands us in the ocean of cyclic existence<br/>Once realized to be without intrinsic nature,<br/>Makes everything a golden land, child.<br/><br/>If you meditate on the illusion-like nature<br/>Of illusion-like phenomena,<br/>Actual illusion-like Buddhahood<br/>Will occur through the power of devotion.',a:'Niguma'},
    {q:'The true intent behind this instruction to give victory to others and take defeat upon ourselves, it is not to follow a certain type of behavior; rather, the deeper intent is to direct our attention inward, whenever we are blamed for something even if we have not done anything wrong. The usual reaction is to become angry but the instruction here is to relax and direct our attention inward. Looking carefully at our inner state of mind allows us to respond from a more relaxed place.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'People perform a vast number of complex practices<br/>hoping to gain spiritual merit as countless as the grains<br/>of sand on the riverbed of the Ganges:<br/>but you are essentially already perfect in every way.<br/>Don’t try and augment perfection with meaningless practice.<br/>If it’s the right occasion to perform them, let practices happen.<br/>When the time has passed, let them stop.<br/>If you are not absolutely sure that mind is the Buddha,<br/>and if you are attached to the ideas of winning merit from spiritual practices, then your thinking is misguided and not in harmony with the Way.<br/>To practice complex spiritual practices is to progress step by step:<br/>but the eternal Buddha is not a Buddha of progressive stages.<br/>Just awaken to the one Mind,<br/>and there is absolutely nothing to be attained.<br/>This is the real Buddha.',a:'Huang Po'},

    {q:'When you see yourself as the Vajrasattva yidam deity—<br/>or any other yidam deity—<br/>you don’t have to actually look that way, just invoke the deity. <br/>If the dress, hair, and jewels arise, fine. <br/>But at this point it is not so much about the form; <br/>it is about confidence in your indestructible Buddha nature.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'By seeing that all the pleasures and luxuries of this world do not last, that they are hollow and futile, attachment naturally decreases. One gains a spontaneous taste for liberation and enlightenment. One can then embark on the path without any turning back. Manjushri said, “If you are attached to this life, you are not a practitioner. If you are attached to samsaric existence, you have no renunciation. If you are attached to selfish aims, you have no bodhicitta. If you have any attachment at all, you don’t have the view.”',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Closing your heart is the original sin.',a:'Anam Thubten Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Doesn’t it seem that something positive always emerges from a broken heart? A tender heart has unlimited “give” while a brittle or contracted heart—a heart focused solely on me and mine—has no choice but to break. If we allow our heart to continuously break as a practice, we will make space for the infinite suffering and beauty of our world, excluding no one. So I say: let it break.',a:'Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel'},

    {q:'The essence of dharma lies in being true to oneself (one\'s innate nature) and in exerting great effort to be courageous. When truth and the courage to walk on the path of truth are joined with mindfulness, a practitioner truly begins to practice the dharma. Until these qualities of truth and courage are generated, we will be vulnerable to our own pretenses and fabrications.<br/><br/>The arising of truth and courage allows us to realize the core essence of dharma. Not understanding this leads us into the trap of endless cyclic existence. A lack of courage keeps us from being true to our buddhanature.<br/><br/>Both virtuous and nonvirtuous actions are formed in the mind. Actions, though more apparent, are secondary to our motivation. Even an apparently virtuous action is of little benefit if the root of our motivation is selfishness. Any action performed with wisdom and selfless motivation is an expression of our own buddhanature.',a:'Mindrolling Trichen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'For many years you have been listening to teachings, receiving numerous empowerments, studying on your own, and being blessed with the kindness and wisdom of many, many teachers. Now it is essential to really focus and begin to work with that—accurately, so there is no discrepancy between the view and meditation.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When a water drop merges with the ocean, it is indivisible from the ocean. And the one space on the outside and inside of a broken vase cannot be differentiated, but extends into a single, all-pervasive space. Likewise, in the identification within yourself of the pure awareness, the nature of your mind, there is nothing to be altered and nothing else with which to engage.',a:'Sera Khandro'},
    {q:'Our minds are usually caught up in thoughts relating to the past, present and future. When one ceases to follow such thoughts and lets one’s mind settle in a natural state, as it is, without movement or distraction, this is called meditation.',a:'Bokar Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Do not encumber your mind with useless thoughts. What good is it to brood over the past and fret about the future? Dwell in the simplicity of the present moment.

    {q:'Egocentrism, which affects us all in varying degrees, prevents us from feeling love and compassion toward others. But to be truly happy, one must have a mind at peace, and peace of mind will come only through altruistic love. Of course, to cultivate compassion, it is not enough to believe in its benefits or marvel at the beauty of such feelings. We have to make an effort and use all the circumstances of daily life to change our thoughts and behavior.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},

    {q:'For the beginning mahamudra practitioner, it is important to meditate in brief sessions. One way to do this is through singing Milarepa songs. One way to proceed is to sing a song and then rest briefly in the meditation. This is profound upaya for mahamudra practice, because what is pointed out in the songs is the view, meditation, conduct, and related areas, presented in the truly profound words of Milarepa. While singing, one is developing mindfulness of these, which then carries over into the meditation. And having rested for a brief time in meditation, one could then sing another song presenting view, meditation, conduct, and fruition from a somewhat different angle.<br/><br/>If you adopt this technique, your understanding of view, meditation, conduct, and fruition will develop and, not only that, these different aspects of the practice will develop together, in a simultaneous and integrated fashion. This is a profound method for practicing mahamudra in brief sessions.',a:'Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Listening to the teachings—you’ve already heard hundreds of teachings, <br/>But when you haven’t grasped the meaning of even one teaching, <br/>What’s the point of more listening? <br/><br/>Reflecting on the teachings—even though you’ve listened, <br/>If the teachings aren’t coming to mind when needed, <br/>What’s the point of more reflection?

    {q:'Your motivation is most important. Motivation will determine your path. You should not listen to this teaching even for the sake of your enlightenment. Who cares about your enlightenment, one\'s own enlightenment. That is the Mahayana attitude...... I don\'t care about I get enlightenment or not, I want everyone to be enlightened...... that is your motivation.<br/>You should not be worried about whether you are practicing Dharma OK, that you are sitting properly or not, you are getting closer to the enlightenment or not, ... those are very lesser attitude, coward attitude..... you should try to avoid that.<br/>If you motivation is grand, then you will hear it in a grand way.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Whether others are beautiful or ugly, benevolent or cruel, they are all sentient beings like us. And like us, they want to be happy and not suffer, which is their right, just like us.

As we get accustomed to this impartial altruism, we finally experience a sense of universal responsibility.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},

    {q:'When you practice meditation, if you get pissed off or discouraged when you find you are distracted, then you don\'t know why you are meditating.<br/>First, see the conditions of your discontent in life/why you aren\'t happy, then you will start to see all your negative emotions. When you look deeper, you will see the negative emotions arise from the judgement thoughts of "I, me, my". If you can clearly see that the "I" is the trouble maker, then you can gradually convince yourself to train to reduce the "I", and this is the very purpose of the path of meditation.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The path is learning to go beyond hopes and fears and just rest in what is happening in the moment. To have security in the insecurity<br/>And the only security we can have in insecurity is by resting in the nature of our mind because there\'s no security outside',a:'Jetsünma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'At night, it is good to examine what you have thought and done during the day, and to confess your faults and unconsidered actions and repair them. Tell yourself that, having encountered a teacher and received his instructions, you know better than to behave in that way. As for your positive actions, dedicate the merit to all beings and vow to improve on them the following day.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When we work with people, we should examine our minds and our intentions completely. Please be careful. Make sure your intentions are clear. Make sure you are not going to reproduce the problems that you are trying to clean up. Our intention is to save individuals from intense pain. We want to make sure that what we are doing is genuine, absolutely genuine—not presenting further problems or creating further pain. Whatever we do has to be genuine, true, and straightforward.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You should work with whatever is your greatest obstacle first - whether it is aggression, passion, pride, arrogance, jealousy, or what have you. You should not just say "I will sit more first, and I will deal with that later." Working with the greatest defilements means working with the highlights of your experience or your problems.

    {q:'When thoughts come while you are meditating, let them come; there\'s no need to regard them as your enemies. When they arise, relax in their arising. On the other hand, if they don’t arise, don\'t be nervously wondering whether or not they will. Just rest in their absence. If big, well-defined thoughts suddenly appear during your meditation, it is easy to recognize them. But when slight, subtle movements occur, it is hard to realize that they are there until much later. This is what we call namtok wogyu, the undercurrent of mental wandering. This is the thief of your meditation, so it is important for you to keep a close watch. If you can be constantly mindful, both in meditation and afterward, when you are eating, sleeping, walking, or sitting, that\'s it – you\'ve got it right!',a:'Düdjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The teachings of the Dharma have great power, but unless you practice them properly that power will remain merely as a potential which is never expressed. If one has a tool and does not use it, not much will be accomplished. An unused tool is not particularly beneficial in itself. But if you truly put the teachings into practice, as the Dharma takes birth and grows in your mindstream, all your faults will naturally diminish and all your positive qualites will spontaneously blossom, just as the sun, as it rises higher in the morning, gradually spreads increasing light throughout the world.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You connect with yourself through meditation. You connect with others and humanity through a good heart.',a:'Orgyen Chowang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'As we go through life, we accumulate layers of ideas about who we are and what we’re capable of achieving. As these layers accumulate, we tend to become increasingly rigid in our identification with certain views about ourselves and the world around us. Gradually, we lose our connection to the basic openness, clarity, and love that is the essence of our being. Our awareness is overwhelmed by hundreds of different thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Some we latch onto because they’re attractive fantasies or scary preoccupations; some we try to shove away because they’re too upsetting or because they distract us from whatever we’re trying to accomplish at the moment.<br/>Instead of focusing on some of them and pushing away others, though, just look at them as feathers flying in the wind. The wind is your awareness, your inborn openness and clarity. Feathers — the thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations that pass through our awareness — are harmless. Some may be more attractive than others, some less attractive; but essentially they’re just feathers. Look at them as fuzzy, curly things floating through the air.<br/>As you do so, you begin to identify with the awareness that is watching the feathers and allow yourself to be okay with whatever feathers happen to be flying at the time. You’re accepting them without latching on to them or trying to shove them away. This simple act of acceptance — which may only last a few seconds — offers a taste of that open space of essence love, an acceptance of the warmth that is your basic nature, the heart of your own being.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Many people are afraid of being brainwashed by religion. But there is no fear of brainwashing in Buddhism; we know we are already brainwashed by ego. Because ego does nothing but create pain and suffering, Buddhism is about getting unbrainwashed. It’s about waking up from this hypnotic state of subservience to ego. Through meditation and self-reflection, our own awareness bears witness to ego’s “indoctrination”.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Human intelligence is the source of our problems. But it would be foolish to think that the solution is to reduce intelligence.

    {q:'Some people may have the idea that these teachings on compassion and exchanging self and others are part of the \'gradual path\' teachings of the sutras, and are not nearly as effective as the more advanced \'direct path\' teachings of the Great Perfection or the Great Seal. That is a complete misunderstanding. Only if you have developed the love and compassion of relative bodhichitta can absolute bodhichitta - the very essence of the Great Perfection and the Great Seal - ever take birth in your being.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Everyone is in such a hurry to think about the absolute, but first you have to learn the beauty of appearance. You take appearance for granted. How can you understand emptiness if you cannot understand what is most apparent?',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Now, when we meditate and practice, what is really happening to us is that our primordial wisdom is awakening. That’s what it is. When we meditate, what we are doing is allowing our primordial wisdom to awaken. Even in an ordinary, day to day situation, like when you are in a terrible dilemma; if you are able to ask your friends to leave the room, and then you say to yourself "I’m going to sit down and be quiet." If you do that for half an hour, then no matter what kind of terrible dilemma that you are in, you will see the situation very clearly. You will have a perspective over your problem, and you might even find out, to your surprise, that there is no problem at all. Maybe what you were calling a problem half an hour ago is actually a very good thing. Maybe it is exactly what you need to get, for what you want to achieve. Otherwise, it might be something that is a problem indeed, but there is more solution than problem itself, and I can guarantee you one thing (this is my little experience through the blessing of the dharma): the solution for the problem is in the problem. I guarantee you. It is always there. It is just like a question: when somebody asks a question, if that person breaks down that question for themselves then that is the answer. The answer is in the question, you know? The solution is in the problem, but it is very hard to see – especially if it is your problem. You can feel your problem from the tip of your hair into the middle of your bones, and therefore you cannot have the perspective easily, but if you can relax then you are able to see more clearly. That’s the principle of meditation. When you meditate with sacred methods of meditation then, through the blessing of the lineage and so forth, that potential for seeing things clearly – the primordial wisdom – awakens. Even temporarily, it makes all the difference on earth, all the difference that you can think of. It will make a big difference, an enormous difference.',a:'Tai Situ Rinpoche'},

    {q:'To see if you’re aware of impermanence or not, check whether your plans are long or short term. To see if you perceive samsara as flawed or not, check how strong is your attachments. To see if you’ll attain liberation in the future or not, check whether your conduct is good or bad. To see if you’ve given rise to loving kindness and compassion or not, check how you take care of those in need. To see if you’ve tamed the demon of anger or not, check how much hatred you feel towards your enemies. To see if you’ve dispelled the obscuring demon of ignorance or not, check how much you cling in hope and fear. To see if you’ve purified the three poisons or not, check how free from grasping you’ve become. You’ll know your Dharma practice has become the path or not by thoroughly examining your own mind.',a:'Chokgyur Lingpa'},

    {q:'Please understand that all sentient beings, all our parents, want nothing but happiness. Unfortunately, through their negative actions they only create the causes for further pain and suffering. Take this to heart and consider all our parents, wandering blindly and endlessly through painful samsaric states. When we truly take this to heart, out of compassion we feel motivated to achieve enlightenment to truly help all of them. This compassionate attitude is indispensable as a preparation for practice.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Before wanting to take care of others, one must first be able to love oneself. Loving oneself is not based on a sense of personal debt for which one is accountable to oneself but simply on the fact that by nature we all strive to be happy and not suffer. It is only after accepting this benevolence toward oneself that it is possible to extend it to all others.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Do all that you can to bring your own stubborn mind under control and to develop your faith, diligence and renunciation. Never think that the dharma you are practising is for your benefit alone. To recite even a single mani mantra is of inconceivable benefit, so dedicate it for the sake of all who live.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Of sustained calm and profound insight, it is profound insight that is most important; but profound insight cannot arise without a preliminary calming of the mind. What is crucial here is to calm all the wild thoughts that constantly agitate, unsettle, and condition the mind, for such thoughts give rise to negative emotions which, in turn, you express as the words and actions that comprise the causes of suffering.<br/><br/>Calming the mind is like closing the glass of a lantern around the flame, so that it can shine brightly and steadily, protected from the wind.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

Therefore, Bodhicitta should be the main point in the practice of all practitioners, those who thirst for the most supreme happiness.

    {q:'The basic idea of the practice is actually very joyful. It is wonderful that human beings can do such a fantastic exchange and that they are willing to invite such undesirable situations into their world. It is wonderful that they are willing to let go of even their smallest corners of secrecy and privacy, so that their holding on to anything is gone completely. That is very brave. We could certainly say that this is the world of the warrior, from the Bodhisattva\'s point of view.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},

This is the essential point.',a:'Chagdüd Tülku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Sometimes you might doubt that all sentient beings have buddha-nature. You might find it hard to imagine that this potential for compassion exists in everyone when violence, massacres, genocide, and “ethnic cleansing” are happening throughout the world. You might even begin to believe that human nature is basically evil. But this is not the case. If, through introspection and meditation, you look deeply at the mind itself, you will apprehend the most fundamental aspect of consciousness, pure awareness. This nature of mind remains unspoiled even though obscuring emotions might temporarily cover it.',a:'Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche'},

Likewise, it is impossible for our mind to experience great results on the buddhist path if it has continuous agitation and dullness. The less agitation and dullness, the greater the stability and clarity, therefore the more power the mind has during any meditation on the path, whether sutra, tantra, or dzogchen.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'By sincerely training in the meditation practice of exchanging suffering for happiness, you will eventually become capable of actually taking on others\' illnesses and curing them and giving them your happiness in reality. Moreover, those with harmful intentions, even evil spirits who try to steal people\'s life force, will be powerless to harm either you or anyone else if you exchange their suffering and hatred with your happiness and peace.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Desire and attachment will not change overnight, but desire becomes less ordinary as we redirect our worldly yearning toward the aspiration to become enlightened for the benefit of others. At the same time, we don’t abandon the ordinary objects of our desires – relationships, wealth, fame – but our attachment to them lessens as we contemplate their impermanence. Not rejecting them, rejoicing in our fortune when they arise, yet recognizing that they won’t last, we begin to build qualities of spiritual maturity. As our attachment slowly decreases, harmful actions that would normally result from attachment are reduced. We create less negative karma, more fortunate karma, and the mind’s positive qualities gradually increase.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We need to seriously investigate whether people who have fame, power, and wealth are happy and whether those who have nothing are always unhappy. When we look into this, we see that happiness is not based on objects but on one’s mental state. For that reason, those who are truly happy are the ones who appreciate what they have. Whenever we are content, in that moment, we are fulfilled. The teachings of the Buddha are common sense.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It should be clearly understood that anyone who has realized the nature of emptiness experiences the spontaneous arising of bodhicitta. There is no realization of emptiness that doesn\'t inherently contain bodhicitta. Just like fire is hot, the nature of emptiness is compassion.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In many ways, the events of samsara are like a big movie. There are so many things happening without any kind of order—like a movie on the big screen spontaneously arising all the time, and we are part of that movie. Everything is constantly changing. It is very important to look at this closely and come to really understand this.<br/><br/>The Buddha said that just like the elephant has the biggest footprint among all animals, the thought of impermanence is the best among all our thoughts. To reflect on impermanence means to look closely at our nature and our environment without ignoring or trying to hide anything. The ego is very tricky—it doesn’t like to deal with the true face of reality. It likes to hide and ignore things because of its grasping and clinging. Looking closely at reality, and taking this opportunity to make our selves and others better is our goal as sangha members and practitioners.',a:'Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches'},
    {q:'Ignorance literally means “not knowing.” What is it that is supposed to be known? We need to be able to know our basic nature - the original unconditioned state that lies at the very heart of every moment of consciousness. Whatever that nature is, it is not derived from religion or philosophy. It has to do with simply with what is. Knowing the natural state is not a frame of mind. It’s not a mode of perceiving. As a matter of fact, our basic nature is totally free of concepts.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The secret, all the time, is what is closest to you without you even knowing. That is why it is called a secret. Many people think Dharma is something far away, something distant. Oh no my friends! Dharma is so close, closer than your own heartbeat, but you never hear it, or you never feel. So it is like a secret with yourself. Within you, is the secret you didn’t realize. <br/><br/>In order to practice Dharma genuinely, you need to make mistakes. When you make mistakes you learn more, you develop more. Without making mistakes, and then seeing the results, without putting in the effort, you cannot improve in Dharma practice. Likewise dharma practice is something you must apply practically in your life. If it\'s not practical, if you can\'t apply it, it\'s not Dharma.<br/><br/>When you see your mistakes, your faults, please start to think that this means you are actually improving. When you see your improving, you need to think what you are revealing is actually your innate nature. When you see the innate nature, you need to, without any grasping, you need to maintain genuinely, you need to let go of all the concepts that you ever have. That is the secret that is within our heart but nobody knows it, and nobody hears it.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Not allowing your mind to become fidgety and restless, make yourself comfortable on your seat in a retreat cabin. This is the surest way to gain the riches of a Dharma practitioner.',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Whoever doesn\'t flare up at someone who\'s angry wins a battle hard to win',a:'Buddha'},
    {q:'The ultimate teacher, the absolute, is never separate from us,<br/>Yet immature beings, not recognizing this, <br/>look outside and seek him far away,<br/>Sole father, with your immense love <br/>you have shown me my own wealth;<br/>I, who was a pauper,<br/>constantly feel your presence in the depth of my heart.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is important to learn to relax with intense feelings such as depression, insecurity and fear. There is no need to label them “no good” or “unpleasant” and no need to get rid of them. Just let them be. This is much simpler and more effective than trying to avoid fear or get rid of fearful things, which won’t work in any case. If our mind is spacious enough to accommodate our emotions, we will discover their wakeful potential. Recognizing the incredible energy within a feeling such as fear, we become fearless in the face of fear.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There is the mud, and there is the lotus that grows out of the mud. We need the mud in order to make the lotus.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'As we wake in the morning and before we go to sleep at night, we remind ourselves that our goal is to develop and realize compassion. This is all we need. Other meditations and mantras are useful but it is only compassion that embodies the very deepest wisdom. To carry out our decision to liberate every sentient being, our day should begin and end with the thought of removing all suffering for everyone, forever.',a:'Ringu Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It’s vital always to bear in mind that we practise for the sake of all other beings, and that the enormity of this aspiration is what makes dharma practice both extremely powerful and inexhaustible, virtually guaranteeing that the result will be infinitely beneficial.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Buddhanature can be summed up in a single word: courage - specifically the courage to be just as we are, right here, right now, with all our doubts and uncertainties.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},

    {q:'When it comes to cultivating the mind, better to be like a donkey than a horse; while the horse is still being saddled, the donkey has reached the mountain pass!',a:'6th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Your beliefs don’t make you a better person, your behavior does. <br/>Your mind training doesn’t matter when you don’t have compassion.<br/>Your meditation doesn’t matter when you don’t see your own faults.<br/>Dharma practice doesn’t matter when you don’t have devotion. <br/>Obstacles don\'t matter when you have the blessings.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you try to defend yourself are giving too much importance to the words of others and give more strength to their opinions. If you accept not defend yourself you are showing that the opinions of others do not affect you, you" hear ". They are simply opinions and that you do not have to convince others to be happy.<br/>Your inner silence makes you serene. Practice the art of not speaking. You will progressively develop the art of speaking without speaking and your true inner nature will replace your artificial personality by letting the light of your heart and the power of wisdom "noble silence." Respect the lives of others and everything that exists in the world. Do not try to force, manipulate and control others. Become your own teacher and let others be what they are or what they have capacity to be.<br/>Put yourself in the silence and harmony of the whole universe.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'Wonder,<br/>Who has the magic to make the sun<br/>appear every morning?<br/>Who makes that bird on the elegant tree chirp?<br/>Breath, pulse, music, dew, sunset,<br/>The burning ambers of the fall.<br/>There is unfathomable joy in all that.<br/>Life is a stream.<br/>It flows on its own.<br/>No one knows why we are here.<br/>Stop trying to figure out the great mystery.<br/>The tea in front of you is getting cold.<br/>Drink it.<br/>Enjoy every drop of it.<br/>And dance.<br/>Dance until there is no more dancer,<br/>It is the dance without dancer.<br/>This is how great mystics dance.',a:'Anam Thubten Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Indeed, try as you might, there is no way you will ever be rid of your attachment and hatred as long as you keep believing that they arise because of the external objects or circumstances to which they are connected. The more you attempt to reject external phenomena, the more they will spring back at you. Hence, therefore, the importance of recognizing the empty nature of your thoughts and simply allowing them to dissolve.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Human beings will continue to deceive and overpower one another. Basically, everyone exists in the very nature of suffering, so to abuse or mistreat each other is futile. The foundation of all spiritual practice is love. That you practice this well is my heart\'s desire.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'When a rainbow appears vividly in the sky, you can see its beautiful colors, yet you could not wear as clothing or put it on as an ornament. It arises through the conjunction of various factors, but there is nothing about it that can be grasped. Likewise, thoughts that arise in the mind have no tangible existence or intrinsic solidity. There is no logical reason why thoughts, which have no substance, should have so much power over you, nor is there any reason why you should become their slave.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is important to realize that all the happiness and suffering, joy and sorrow you are experiencing now have not been decided for you by gods such as Indra, Brahma, and Vishnu, nor have they come about on their own. They are the natural result of your own past actions.<br/>So make a promise that even if the whole world rises up as your enemy, you will not wander from the absolute nature. Then, even if someone appears to threaten your life, if you can remain in equanimity within the recognition of the absolute nature, that enemy will be unable to harm you.<br/>But if you fall into delusion, thinking that enemies exist truly, and as a result you react by trying to defeat them and to protect others who arouse attachment in you, then you will surely be betraying the Buddhas of the past, present, and future.<br/>Be mindful at all times of what is right and what is not; and be vigilant as to whether you are actually acting accordingly. Mindfulness and vigilance will then be your teachers.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Discipline is very important, but it has to have the spirit of letting go behind it.',a:'Elizabeth Mattis-Namgyel'},
    {q:'The deepest reasons to love yourself have nothing to do with anything outside you — not with your body or with others\' expectations of you. If you ground yourself in your own goodness, nothing will be able to damage your self-esteem. Take delight in your inner nature, in your virtues, and in all your beautiful qualities.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'The work of bringing benefit to beings<br/>Will not, then, make me proud and self-admiring.<br/>The happiness of others is itself my satisfaction;<br/>I do not expect another recompense.',a:'Shantideva'},
    {q:'The paradox of awareness is very profound, and yet very simple. It can\'t be described because it has no objective qualities, and no limitation. Sometimes it comes naturally to the surface when we are fully in the present moment and no longer lost in thought or mental projections. <br/>Pure consciousness is neither high nor low, neither pleasant nor unpleasant, neither good nor bad. No matter where we are, no matter what we are doing, we always have an immediate access to that inner stillness. It can be experienced in an instant in all circumstances once we know how to pay attention to it. It is utterly peaceful and it is also insightful, so it sees through all illusions. <br/>Whenever there is a moment of being deluded, we can use that moment to practice settling in the very perfect sphere of the Buddha mind without trying to change anything. When we reside in that liberated mind, we find the very thing we have been seeking all along.',a:'Anam Thubten Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The purpose of studying buddhism is not to study buddhism but to study ourselves. It is impossible to study ourselves without some teaching… We need some teaching, but just by studying the teaching alone, it is impossible to know what ‘I’ in myself am. Through the teaching we may understand our human nature. But the teaching is not we ourselves; it is some explanation of ourselves. So if you are attached to the teaching, or to the teacher, you should leave the teacher, and you should be independent. You need a teacher so that you can become independent. If you are not attached to him[her], the teacher will show you the way to yourself.',a:'Shunryu Suzuki'},
    {q:'Strive unceasingly for purification, banish ignorance and gather merit. Doing so, you will not only see the Dharma-loving deities come to listen, you will even perceive within yourselves, the Dharmakaya, holiest and highest of all deities. Seeing that, you will then behold the whole truth of Samsara and Nirvana and you will free yourselves from karma.',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'We have a confused society, in which everybody struggles to protect himself or herself, and where genuine, basic kindness itself seems so very difficult. But if we sit down and think about it, compassion and kindness aren\'t something that we have to learn from someone else. Kindness is the intrinsic nature; it is an intrinsic feeling that we all appreciate, and one really doesn\'t need especially to meditate or practice how to become a good person, how to refrain from harming another person, or to realize that killing, stealing, lying, and so on are negative. All of us [already] understand that.',a:'Jetsün Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When we see defects in others, people in general but particularly those who have entered the Dharma, who are the banner of the monastic robes, are the support for the offerings of gods and men alike, we should understand that it is the impurity of our perception which is at fault. When we look into a mirror, we see a dirty face because our own face is dirty. In the same way, the defects of others are nothing but our impure way of seeing them.<br/><br/>By thinking this way, we should try to rid ourselves of this perception of the faults of other, and cultivate the attitude whereby the whole of existence, all appearances, are experienced as pure.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Although mind is clear, one needs a lama;<br/>Although a lamp burns brightly, it still needs oil;<br/>Although mind is self-evident, it needs recognition.<br/><br/>That is the teaching on the three needs.',a:'Drugpa Kunley'},
    {q:'Death can not be fought off by any warrior, ordered away by the powerful, or paid off by the rich. Death leaves nowhere to run to, no place to hide, no refuge, no defender or guide.<br/><br/>So, reflect sincerely and meditate on how important it is from this very moment onwards never to slip into laziness and procrastination, but to practice the true Dharma, the only thing you can be sure will help at the moment of death.',a:'Patrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Crush the eggshell of the mind and unfold your wings in the open sky. Destroy the hut of duality and inhabit the expansive mansion of pure awareness. There are no other enemies or obstacles to overcome and vanquish. Ignorance - dualistic thinking - is the great demon obstructing your path. Slay it right now and be free!',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'You actually have this awareness within you. It is the clear, naked wisdom of dharmakaya. But who can introduce you to it? On what should you take your strand? What should you be certain of? To begin with, it is your teacher that shows you the state of your awareness. And when you recognize it for yourself, it is then that you are introduced to your own nature.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Once you have committed to a particular path, I suggest that you look for the simplest way forward. You should make things accessible and approachable in your religious community and in your personal practice, rather than more complicated.<br/>Keep it simple. The life of the spirit is actually very basic and easy. We often don’t appreciate that. In the beginning, our spiritual path may strike us as very simple and perfectly clear. But then, after we have been practicing it for a few years, we sometimes find ourselves going backward, and moving away from that initial simplicity. The spiritual breakthrough we experience may simply consist in rediscovering what we had seen in the beginning.<br/>Spiritual discovery is not a matter of finding wisdom out there somewhere. It is a matter of discovering what already exists within us. Like cleaning the surface of a stone inscription, the more you clean it, the more the original carving becomes apparent. We are like that stone. With spiritual practice, instead of gaining something we did not have before, we gradually make ourselves clearer to ourselves.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'A merchant crossing a forest infested with thieves would keep a weapon ready to hand. A traveler passing through a country ravaged by plague would take with him an assortment of medicines. In the same way, living as you do under the constant threat of emotions like anger, desire, pride, jealousy and many others, you should always be ready to fight them off with the appropriate antidotes. Constant vigilance is the mark of a sincere practitioner. You may know how to practice when everything is going well, but that is of little use if you succumb to the first emotion that hits you.<br/><br/>Good practitioners can be recognized by their response to difficult situations liable to provoke latent emotions. Those capable of reacting immediately with the correct antidote will have no problem overcoming obstacles.<br/><br/>In particular, if they know how to transcend the concepts of subject and object, all their thoughts will liberate themselves, like a snake wriggling out of the knots tied in its own body, without effort or help. When you trace all thoughts and concepts back to their very source, you will recognize that they all have the same true nature - emptiness inseparable from transcendent wisdom.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Mind Training should be engaged in discreetly. It should not be done with external show, in a way that attracts attention and creates a reputation; it should act as the inward antidote to our self-clinging and defiled emotions. We should bring our minds to ripeness without anybody knowing.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'To come across a precious jewel<br/>Is nothing compared to finding this precious human life.<br/>Look how those who are not saddened by samsara<br/>Fritter life away!<br/><br/>To win a whole kingdom<br/>Is nothing compared to meeting a perfect teacher.<br/>Look how those with no devotion<br/>Treat the teacher as their equal!<br/><br/>To be given command of a province<br/>Is nothing compared to receiving the Bodhisattva vows.<br/>Look how those with no compassion<br/>Hurl their vows away!<br/><br/>To rule over the universe<br/>Is nothing compared to receiving a tantric empowerment.<br/>Look how those who do not keep the samayas<br/>Jettison their promises!<br/><br/>To catch sight of the Buddha<br/>Is nothing compared to seeing the true nature of mind.<br/>Look how those with no determination<br/>Sink back into delusion!',a:'Patrul Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Your mind, the primordial buddha, searches elsewhere by the power of desire. Doesn\'t it notice that it is wandering in samsara?<br/>Now when you have obtained the precious human body, you continuously get carried away by mundane actions. Don\'t you notice that your life is running out?',a:'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There is no other difﬁcult practice equal to patience - not getting angry with someone who harms you, and even if you do get angry, not remaining so. It is the ultimate austerity. Therefore do not allow yourself even the slightest occasion for anger, which is incompatible with such a sublime austerity as patience.',a:'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We all know that Bodhichitta begins to develop in us when we have met with a Teacher and received his teachings. If, with the seed of Bodhichitta once planted in our hearts, we continue to practise, evildoers and the troubles they cause, indeed suffering in general, will all conspire to make our Bodhichitta grow. There is therefore no difference between our enemies and our Teachers. Knowing that suffering brings about the growth of the two Bodhichittas, we must take advantage of it.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A fish caught in a net can’t go anywhere, but if the net is cut with a knife, the fish can freely swim anywhere it likes in the vast ocean. Likewise, awareness is enveloped by many conceptual and discursive thoughts, but if these thoughts are destroyed over and over again, awareness will be laid bare.<br/>When the husk is removed from a grain of rice, it becomes edible, and when the husk is removed from a grain of barley, good tsampa can be made from it.<br/>Likewise, awareness must be divested of the discursive mind and the husk of meditative experiences.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Be compassionate to yourself, even as you look at your mistakes and mishaps. Then, if others are less than perfect too, use your developing compassion to kill your anger and frustration.

    {q:'“I will be sick, I will grow old, I will die, I will be separated from those I love, my relations and so forth. In such manner, the fully ripened effect of my actions will come to me and to no one else, and I am therefore not above depending on what I did in former lives.” <br/><br/>To think like this again and again is the antidote to such things as arrogance. Make every effort not to become arrogant by meditating on this antidote.',a:'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It is important to realize that there is nobody else who can wake us up and save us from samsara. There is no such thing in Buddhism. That may be Buddhism’s biggest drawback, and at the same time its greatest advantage. This view shows us that there is nobody else in control of our lives, our experiences, our freedom or our bondage. Who is responsible? Who is in control? It is us. We are in control. We can bind ourselves further in samsara or we can free ourselves from it right now. It is all up to us. We are the ones who have to keep looking at our thoughts, looking for the nature of our mind. There is no guru, deity, buddha or bodhisattva out there to look for it for us. Although they would happily do this, it would not help us; it would only help them. We have to do it for ourselves. That is the key point.',a:'Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Everything has the nature of being empty.<br/>When the empty looks at the empty,<br/>Who is there to look at something empty?<br/>What is the use of many classifications,<br/>Such as \'being empty\' and \'not empty\'<br/>As it is illusion looking at illusion,<br/>And delusion watching delusion?',a:'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When I become enmeshed in selfishness, I will offer my own happiness to living beings so as to counteract it. In the same way, should a companion be ungrateful to me, I will be content in knowing that this is in retribution for my own inconstancy.',a:'Dharmarakshita'},
    {q:'The application of mindfulness has to be precise. If we cling to our practice, we create stagnation. Therefore, in our application of the techniques of mindfulness, we must be aware of the fundamental tendency to cling, to survive. We come to this in the mindfulness of life, or survival. We encounter this tendency in the form of clinging to the meditative state. We experience the meditative state and it is momentarily tangible, but in that same moment it is also dissolving. Going along with this process means developing a sense of letting go of awareness as well as of contacting it. This could be described as touch-and-go: you are there—present, mindful—and then you let go.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We human beings are all parts of the same body. Just because we do not wish to acknowledge another person’s importance does not mean that this person is unimportant to our well-being. Just because we do not wish to acknowledge what we share with others does not mean that we can separate ourselves from them. Interdependence is an inescapable truth of our existence.<br/><br/>Of course, we are not all identical. Because certain differences do exist between us, we all have something to offer each other.

Some people today are not willing to study or reflect on the Dharma, but they are enthusiastic about meditation. They believe meditating all day with their eyes shut is the ultimate practice. I do not think much of this. Although there are people of the highest caliber who attain enlightenment without study or reflection, are you of such caliber? Therefore, you cannot live in a cave or another completely isolated place when you first start to practice. Instead, you should be with a qualified Dharma teacher and earnestly receive the Buddhadharma; it is best if you are always engaged in study, reflection, and practice. Of course, I am not asking you to study and reflect for a lifetime without ever practicing. But to spend an entire life in blind meditation without any study or reflection is also the wrong path!',a:'Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There is no such thing as a vacation from working with our mind. We should continually contemplate how we can go deeper in our practice. Mind training requires nothing external, not even a cushion. All we need is a mind, and that we always have.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Patrul Rinpoche says, “The low seat is the high seat, the noble seat.” Why is this? The answer: because there is nowhere to fall. The low seat is the noble seat because it grounds us in ordinariness and humility. It protects us from our own insecurities and comparing mind. Of course, in society at times, we may need to take a position of authority or leadership, we may need to sit at the head of the table or even on a throne, but as long as we remain humble we can’t fail.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},

Continue until you recognize yourself in everyone in the supermarket, on the street corner, in a concentration camp, on a leaf, in a dewdrop. Meditate until you see yourself in a speck of dust in a distant galaxy. See and listen with the whole of your being. If you are fully present, the rain of Dharma will water the deepest seeds in your consciousness, and tomorrow, while you are washing the dishes or looking at the blue sky, that seed will spring forth, and love and understanding will appear as a beautiful flower.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'Just be kind to each other. Just be kind. No agenda...Just be kind. What is wrong with that? What do you lose from that? What do you gain? A lot! You heal so fast. So fast. That is the fastest way to purification. Kindness is the fastest way to gain Bodhichitta.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},

    {q:'We talk about blind faith in religion, but actual blind faith exists in our everyday world. What do we really trust?

    {q:'A lack of balance in life boils down to not being fully aware in situations and not feeling present. The present moment of action is not properly accomplished, for when a person is halfway through dealing with the present action, he or she is already drifting on to the next action. This produces a kind of indigestion in the mind. There is something always left incomplete, like leaving a fruit half eaten.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Peace is not brought about through conflict, but through compassion creating peace of mind within ourselves. We all need compassion and women can take a lead role in encouraging others to let it flower within them. My own first teacher of kindness and compassion was my mother.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'When we are having happy moments, when we are enjoying our wealth and pleasure, we might just want to remain in that state, and we might not even think about practicing dharma. Therefore, sometimes the best inspiration for dharma practice is actually meeting with enemies, illness, and other such things that might make us suffer.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When starting out on the inner path you need a great amount of courage to go in a different direction from this modern world\'s materialistic culture, particularly if all your family and friends are immersed in it.

    {q:'If we come across certain things that we find difficult to accept even after careful investigation, that doesn\'t mean the whole Dharma has to be thrown overboard. Even now, after all these years, I still find certain things in the Tibetan Dharma which I\'m not sure about at all. I used to go to my Lama and ask him about some of these things, and he would say, "That\'s fine. Obviously you don\'t really have a connection with that particular doctrine. It doesn\'t matter. Just put it aside. Don\'t say, `No, it\'s not true.\' Just say, \'At this point, my mind does not embrace this.\' Maybe later you\'ll appreciate it, or maybe you won\'t.

If you discover how you oppress yourself, your uncontrolled mind will disappear. Knowing your own mind is the solution to all your problems.',a:'Lama Yeshe'},

    {q:'Enhance your life with more openness, more warm-hearted feelings being expressed toward and received from others... This can take any form: loving-kindness, compassion, learning how to be happy on behalf of others, being generous and patient. The warm-hearted feelings of bodhicitta can manifest in all these ways. Surely, then, your life will be enhanced.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The training in recognizing mind essence is this: short moments repeated many times. There is no other way. A short duration guarantees it is actually the authentic mind essence, by itself. Repeating this recognition many times ensures that we will get used to it.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We speak of the preciousness of human existence and its potential for constructive productivity, yet few of us manage to put this into practice before we grow old. We spend decades of our lives wanting happiness, peace, and contentment—without sowing the causes for that aspiration. Why did we not plant the seeds of the fruition we aspire to? Buddhist logic says that if you plant a lemon seed and pray for a mango fruit, logically it won’t work. But this is what we do: we wish for happiness without planting the seeds of happiness.<br/><br/>In fact, we do the exact opposite. We plant the causes of carelessness, thoughtlessness, mindlessness, and a lack of awareness, conscientiousness, and consideration for others and their well being—all the time hoping for happiness and cessation of suffering. Call it karmic patterns, habitual tendencies, neuroses, or whatever—it is essential to understand this human behavior.',a:'Jetsün Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'This empty nature - the lack of inherent existence of phenomena - does not imply that there is nothing at all, as we find in the view of the nihilists. According to relative truth, all phenomena arise as a result of the interdependent conjunction of causes and conditions. This enables us to explain not only how samsara is formed but also how it is possible to progress toward nirvana. There is no contradiction between the absolute nature and its infinite display. Because of this, one is free from the extreme of existence and of nonexistence.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'A mature practitioner will usually have a far purer perception of others than a beginner. The more enlightened qualities a practitioner acquires, the humbler he will become; the more time he spends with his guru, the greater his devotion; and the more he hears and contemplates the dharma, the quicker his pride and arrogance will diminish.<br/><br/>The supreme sign of a great practitioner is not that he sprouts a halo, has extraordinarily auspicious dreams, experiences bliss continuously, or can foresee our miserable futures. The supreme sign is that he no longer has any interest in material gain, fame, the respect of others, or being the centre of attention.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'All descriptions of reality are limited expressions of the world of emptiness. Yet we attach to the descriptions and think they are reality. That is a mistake.',a:'Shunryu Suzuki'},
    {q:'To find a buddha, all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is the buddha. And the buddha is the person who\'s free, free of plans, free of cares. If you don\'t see your nature and run around all day looking somewhere else, you\'ll never find a buddha. The truth is, there\'s nothing to find. But to reach such an understanding you need a teacher. And you need to struggle to make yourself understand.',a:'Bodhidharma'},

    {q:'From morning to night we do everything with the self-cherishing mind. Inside the house, outside the house, getting dressed, walking around, talking to people, working, eating, seeing things, shopping, going to bed—we do everything with self-cherishing.<br/><br/>Even though everything we do is motivated by the wish to obtain temporal happiness and avoid temporal problems, in fact, everything we do creates the cause of greater, continual suffering in the future. For countless previous lifetimes we’ve been carrying on like this, perpetuating the cycle of suffering, living fulltime with the thought of the eight worldly dharmas.<br/><br/>Unless we can break this cycle we will continue like this, doing the same thing on and on endlessly, because we’re using entirely the wrong methods to deal with our immediate worldly problems. We’re forever creating the causes for much greater suffering for ourselves. Really, we are crazy; completely crazy.',a:'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'One way to understand moods is that they are just the habit patterns of our mind continually playing themselves out in different scenarios. According to the view of Dharma, we don’t need to understand them or consider them so much as we need to replace them with new habits. This is where practice comes in. When we practice, we involve our body, emotions and mind in a new habit which is much more “real” in the sense that it is in line with the reality of enlightenment. This is the definition of purification.<br/>The problem with paying much attention at all to emotional states is that we must on some level believe that they are real if we are considering them at all. We reinforce our sense of egoic reality by examining and exploring them, much in the way Narcissus was enamored of his reflection. When we come to practice from that place, we create extra obstacles and encounter even greater resistance.',a:'Adzom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Many people think that meditation requires a lot of effort and it’s something you have to gain. We plug into this idea that somehow it’s something we have to force ourselves to do and at the end of it we will succeed or fail. And I think it’s very important to realize it’s nothing to do with that at all. That’s just the ego wanting to be a meditator.<br/><br/>The whole secret of meditation is to learn just how to be present in the moment and in a state of complete openness and relaxation. It’s not a matter of gaining, it’s a matter of losing, of dropping—letting go, letting go, letting go. I think it’s really very important, especially in this age where we’re all programmed to want to get something that it’s not a matter of what you get, it’s a matter of what you lose.',a:'Jetsünma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'Recognizing the instability of causes and conditions leads us to understand our own power to transform obstacles and make the impossible possible. This is true in every area of life. If you don’t have a Ferrari, you very well may create the conditions to have one. As long as there is a Ferrari, there is the opportunity for you to own one. Likewise if you want to live longer, you can choose to stop smoking and exercise more. There is reasonable hope. Hopelessness — just like its opposite, blind hope — is the result of a belief in permanence.<br/><br/>You can transform not only your physical world but your emotional world, for example, turning agitation into peace of mind by letting go of ambition or turning low self-respect into confidence by acting out of kindness and philanthropy. If we all condition ourselves to put our feet in other people’s shoes, we will cultivate peace in our homes, with our neighbors, and with other countries.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Sometimes we use the view to cover up our conduct.<br/>Sometimes we use our conduct to cover up our view.<br/>Many times we take the view as an easy exit.<br/><br/>If your conduct follows the view, you will end up a complete nihilist.<br/>If your view follows your conduct, your will never get out of duality.<br/><br/>Therefore,<br/>View should be brave.<br/>Conduct should be timid.',a:'Khenpo Tsewang Döngyal Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Most conflicts between people stem from a misunderstanding of one another’s motives. We all have our reasons for doing what we do and saying what we say. The more we allow ourselves to be guided by compassion – to pause for a moment and try to see where another person is coming from – the less likely we are to engage in conflict.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If the first true fact is that life in general is not easy, we should certainly not expect that seeing the nature of our mind will be simple. The actual nature of mind, on any level, is not very obvious. Even to identify and recognize correctly what is mind is extremely difficult. Just to start to try to see it, we need strong motivation. We need to be clear about why we would like to see the nature of our mind.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},

    {q:'If you recognize the emptiness of your thoughts instead of solidifying them, the arising and subsiding of each thought will clarify and strengthen your realization of emptiness.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'There are many different methods for recognizing the Buddha within. Of these, the quickest and easiest is to receive the blessings of the guru. This is why guru devotion is necessary.<br/><br/>For example, you may be having a nightmare about monsters. But then suddenly, somebody throws a bucket of cold water over you and you wake up. The cold water doesn’t really make the monsters disappear, because there were no monsters in the first place. It was just a dream. But on the other hand, when you are having a nightmare, your sufferings are real, and the person who throws the bucket of water over you is indeed very kind and special. If you have a lot of merit you are able to meet such a person, a person who can throw the water. On the other hand, if you don’t have merit, you may never wake up from the nightmare.<br/><br/>The guru lineage originates with someone called Vajradhara or Samantabhadra. Our masters tell us that he is our own mind, the nature of our own mind. This means that when we trace back through the lineage, we actually end up with our own minds, the essence of ourselves. The guru is not some kind of almighty sponsor that we have to worship or obey. The most important thing to understand is that the guru is the display of our buddhanature.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The Buddha compared attachment to drinking salt water from an ocean. The more we drink, the thirstier we get. Likewise, when our mind is conditioned by attachment, however much we have, we never really experience contentment.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Our suffering seems to occur because of the object of our desire or aversion, but that\'s not really so. It happens because the mind splits into object-subject duality and becomes involved in wanting or not wanting something.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Carelessness and impaired mindfulness cause downfalls. Therefore mindfulness is explained first.<br/><br/>To practice mindfulness and awareness of the illusion of inseparable appearance-emptiness of this heartless body as the Victor\'s Body <br/>is the direct application of mindfulness to the body.<br/><br/>The reference-points of pleasure, pain, equanimity, and the sensations of all designated phenomena understood as mere sensation <br/>are the direct application of mindfulness to sensation.<br/><br/>All phenomena are mind,<br/>yet mind will not be found inside or outside.<br/>Mind not existing at all except as illusion<br/>is the application of mindfulness to the mind.<br/><br/>Shrävakas and pretyekabuddhas<br/>label all things as phenomena.<br/>To know them as random labels of mere names<br/>is the application of mindfulness of phenomena.',a:'Niguma'},
    {q:'For most people, to visualise is to focus on an image and then hold it in their mind’s eye. But physical appearance is only one element of visualisation practice, and by no means the whole story. <br/><br/>An individual’s attitudes and understanding changes according to their situation and education. Until very recently, Buddhist masters brought up in Tibet would have looked on salad, green vegetables and grass as animal fodder and would never willingly eat it themselves. Now that Tibetans have become familiar with food outside Tibet, their attitudes have changed, and it is precisely this kind of shift in our perception that we work with in “creation meditation.” <br/><br/>Another example can be found on the World Wide Web. Most erotic pictures are usually quite small—certainly nowhere near life-sized. Logically, it is hard to believe that such tiny images could cause living, breathing human beings to become aroused, but they do. <br/><br/>Our habits are so entrenched that having programmed ourselves to respond to a specific kind of image, it will consistently have the power to turn us on or make us angry, sad or even depressed, even when we see it on a tiny 14 x 8 cm YouTube screen. To a certain extent, this is how visualisation works.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'If you receive empowerment, it\'s about Bodhicitta. If you receive teachings, it\'s about Bodhicitta. If you practice teachings, it\'s about Bodhicitta. Everything comes down to Bodhicitta.

    {q:'The root of liberation from samsara is having the correct view, and the correct view is the view that is free from the different extremes. If one clings to the appearance aspect, one falls into the extreme of eternalism; if one clings to the emptiness aspect, one falls into that of nihilism. We have to be free from clinging to either of these extremes of existence and nonexistence. This cannot be achieved by intellectual fabrication. The absolute nature can only be recognized by direct experience. It is not a question of trying to isolate an empty aspect of the mind and to fix one’s mind on it, or of isolating a clarity aspect of the mind and clinging to that. This sort of intellectual manipulation will never bring us to Buddhahood. Our meditation must therefore be free from the work of the intellect.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'After you have practiced for a while, you will realize that it is not possible to make rapid, extraordinary progress. Even though you try very hard, the progress you make is always little by little. It is not like going out in a shower in which you know when you get wet. In a fog, you do not know you are getting wet, but as you keep walking you get wet little by little. If your mind has ideas of progress, you may say, “Oh, this pace is terrible!” But actually it is not. When you get wet in a fog it is very difficult to dry yourself.

That kind of practice is not our practice.',a:'Shunryu Suzuki'},
    {q:'Daily life is a sequence of cause-and-effect activities. It\'s how the world works. To make tea, first we boil water. To make the light come on, first we flip a switch. The concept of karma enters when we add ethical intention to cause and effect: virtuous activity leads to positive experience, and non-virtuous activity leads to negative experience. When we extend our investigations of cause and effect to intention, motivation, impulses, incentives, and so forth, then we can recognize that this same interplay between cause and effect conditions our mind and shapes our experience. If we want to be happy, we must figure out what causes and conditions lead to well-being. Similarly, if we don\'t have a clear understanding of the conditions that cause suffering, how could we possibly expect to free ourselves from it?',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Just as space is infinitely vast, so too is the number of sentient beings. Yet we tend to think that the only relationships we have with other beings are the tiny number, comparatively, that we have at present. Wherever we live, we like a few people, dislike a few others, and ignore all the rest. Based on this prejudiced and very limited perception of others, we keep giving rise to attachment and aggression. Thus we accumulate karma, the driving force of samsara.<br/>If we could see the endless sequence of lives we have led in the past, we would know that there is not a single being on earth who has not been our father or our mother, not only once but many times over. To return the love and great kindness they have shown us, we must cultivate love and compassion for all of them, as the great enlightened ones do. Above all, we should aspire from the depths of our heart to be able to bring them to perfect enlightenment, without leaving a single one of them behind. The merit arising from such an aspiration is in proportion to the number of beings, so the wish to liberate innumerable beings can engender an immeasurable amount of merit.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In listening to Dharma here, for example, we are already practicing all six paramitas. At this time of day we would normally be relaxing and enjoying ourselves, but we gave up our time to come here and talk about Dharma—we gave some of our time, and this is GIVING. Since a mind without pride and jealousy is a pure mind and the very essence of all ethics, if we listen to the teachings without pride or jealousy, we are practicing ETHICS. While listening to the teachings we get thirsty, we feel hungry, and our knees become sore, but we willingly put up with all these difficulties. In this way we practice PATIENCE. Patience is not simply passive; it demands energy. Listening to the teachings in the constant awareness that we are listening to them is the practice of energy, or DILIGENCE, and concentrating on the importance of the teachings is the practice of CONCENTRATION. Listening attentively to the teachings, thinking about them, and asking questions is the practice of PENETRATING INTUITION in listening to the teachings. One can integrate the six paramitas with any Dharma practice.',a:'Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche'},

    {q:'We are always about self. You want to practise Dharma, kiss bye bye to your ego. Dharma will chop our ego, not pumping our ego. We want 2 things together, Dharma and self importance. It’s a contradiction itself. How can we take in one hand the poison, the bacteria that kills us, in other hand the antidote to cure us. Actually we live day by day in the mirage of what we want to see ourselves. Have you noticed that? We know how we are inside. We don’t want people to see that, our teachers to see that. We create this fake mirage of ourselves, to show people this is who i am. What are we. If you like to live a fake life, it’s up to you. But at least you want to change, if not a great person, at least to be a better human being. Great teachers, not their enlightened mind, but just as a person - patience, loving, sacrificing tremendously to Dharma, starting from small points. That’s result of practice.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Buddha was not a pessimist or a doomsayer; he was a realist, while we tend to be escapists. When he stated that all assembled things are impermanent, he did not intend for that to be bad news; it is a simple, scientific fact.

    {q:'It has been said in the Buddhist teachings that without exertion, you cannot journey on the path at all. When you are taking a holiday or a vacation, you are very inspired to wake up in the morning, because you are expecting to have a tremendous experience. Exertion is like the minute before you wake up on a holiday trip: you trust that you are going to have a good time, but you also have to put your effort into it. So true exertion is some kind of celebration and joy, which is free from laziness.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Imagine yourself as a child lying on your back, gazing up into a cloudless sky, and blowing soap bubbles through a plastic ring. As a bubble drifts up into the sky, you watch it rise, and this brings your attention to the sky. While you are looking at the bubble, it pops, and you keep your attention right where the bubble had been. Your awareness now lies in empty space.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},

    {q:'Last time, someone approached me for blessings, I told him I wouldn’t be able to give him blessings; blessings cannot be obtained from external parties. I told him that there are many impoverished, hungry children outside who are in need of food, education and others, and that if he could help these children receive education and to obtain good meals, he definitely would receive the blessings he is seeking!',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'If it weren’t for my mind, my meditation would be excellent.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'It is quite difficult to have an experience of Dzogchen, but once you do have that experience, it can be extremely beneficial in dealing with your day to day life, your job, and your career. This is because that kind of experience will give you the ability to prevent yourself from being overwhelmed by circumstances, good or bad. You will not fall into extreme states of mind: you will not get over-excited or depressed. Your attitude toward circumstances and events will be as if you were someone observing the mind, without being drawn away by circumstances.<br/><br/>For example, when you see a reflection of a form in a mirror, the reflection appears within the mirror but it is not projected from within. In the same way, when you confront the situations of life, or deal with others, your attitude too will be mirror-like. Also, when a reflection appears in the mirror, the mirror does not have to go after the object that is reflected: it simply reflects, spontaneously, on the surface. The same with you: since there is no attachment or agitation at having these \'reflections\' in your mind, you will feel tremendous ease and relief. You are not preoccupied by what arises in the mind, nor does it cause you any distress. You are free from conceptuality or any form of objectifying. And so it really does help you, in allowing you to be free from being caught up in the play of emotions like hatred, attachment, and the like.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},

    {q:'If you\'re determined to think of yourself as limited, fearful, vulnerable, or scarred by past experience, know only that you have chosen to do so, and that the opportunity to experience yourself differently is always available.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you have a question as to why sentient beings suffer if they do the wrong thing, it is because it is contrary to their potential, they are doing something which is opposite to what they are. Therefore, the results they get are opposite to what they want. That is quite simple logic, don’t you think? We are the embodiment of liberation and freedom and that is ultimate happiness and joy. If we do something that is contrary to that, then we will end up suffering. It is not somebody’s punishment for us. For example, if we throw a rock up in the air, then what will fall on our head will be a rock. If we throw a flower up in the air, then what will fall on our head will be a flower.',a:'Tai Situ Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Support and take refuge in those spiritual masters who focus their practice in solitary retreat. Before one attains enlightenment, one should also enter into solitary retreat to focus on one\'s practice under his or her close guidance and mentorship. If not, it will be just like now, where everywhere is flooded with Khenpos who give empty talks. Those ignorant ones, who run after fame and fortune, and establish their own factions, will cause people to have aversion for Buddhism and lead to the extinction of Buddhism sooner or later. Hence, it is said that the authentic Dharma is not in the monasteries, it is not in the books and not in the material world, but within the mind. There is a need to awaken it through practice and to realised (actualised) it, in order to be called the continuation or preservation of the Dharma.',a:'Chatral Rinpoche'},

    {q:'What do people think spiritual development is? It\'s not lights and trumpets. It\'s very simple. It\'s right here and now. People have this idea that Enlightenment and realization is something in the distance- a very fantastic and magnificent happening which will transform everything once and for always. But it\'s not like that at all. It\'s something which is sometimes so simple you hardly see it. It\'s right here in front of us, so close we don\'t notice it. And it\'s something which can happen at any moment. And the moment we see it, there it is. It\'s been there all the time, but we\'ve had our inner eye closed. When the moments of awareness all link up - then we become a Buddha.',a:'Jetsünma Tenzin Palmo'},

    {q:'Contentment is the most essential thing. Searching for happiness is endless. <br/>There will always be some place or thing more sunnier, better, quieter. The search is never ending and there may rarely be enough time for all the search and finding.<br/>But one who is content is always happy.

    {q:'Those tormented by the pain of anger,<br/>Never know tranquility of mind—<br/>Strangers they will be to every pleasure;<br/>They will neither sleep nor feel secure.',a:'Shantideva'},
    {q:'The everyday practice of dzogchen is simply to develop a complete carefree acceptance, an openness to all situations without limit.<br/><br/>We should realise openness as the playground of our emotions and relate to people without artificiality, manipulation or strategy.<br/><br/>We should experience everything totally, never withdrawing into ourselves as a marmot hides in its hole. This practice releases<br/>tremendous energy which is usually constricted by the process of maintaining fixed reference points. Referentiality is the process by<br/>which we retreat from the direct experience of everyday life.<br/><br/>Being present in the moment may initially trigger fear. But by welcoming the sensation of fear with complete openness, we cut through<br/>the barriers created by habitual emotional patterns.<br/><br/>When we engage in the practice of discovering space, we should develop the feeling of opening ourselves out completely to the entire universe. We should open ourselves with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind. This is the powerful and ordinary practice of dropping the mask of self-protection.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Dualism is the grandmother of arrogance.<br/>As long as you have dualism, you are not humble.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In meditation we discover our inherent restlessness. Sometimes we get up and leave. Sometimes we sit there but our bodies wiggle and squirm and our minds go far away. This can be so uncomfortable that we feel it’s impossible to stay. Yet this feeling can teach us not just about ourselves but also about what it is to be human. All of us derive security and comfort from the imaginary world of memories and fantasies and plans. We really don’t want to stay with the nakedness of our present experience. It goes against the grain to stay present. There are the times when only gentleness and a sense of humor can give us the strength to settle down.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'There’s no way to make a dreadful situation pretty. But we can use the pain of it to recognize our sameness with other people. Shantideva said that since all sentient beings suffer from strong, conflicting emotions, and all sentient beings get what they don’t want and can’t hold on to what they do want, and all sentient beings have physical distress, why am I making such a big deal about just me? Since we’re all in this together, why am I making such a big deal about myself? Whatever usually drags us down and causes us to withdraw into ourselves is actually the stepping-stone for awakening our compassion and for contacting the vast, unbiased mind of the warrior.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'We can stop struggling with what occurs and see its true face without calling it the enemy. It helps to remember that our spiritual practice is not about accomplishing anything—not about winning or losing—but about ceasing to struggle and relaxing as it is. That is what we are doing when we sit down to meditate. That attitude spreads into the rest of our lives.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},

    {q:'Maitri means that we can still be crazy after all these years. We can still be angry after all these years. We can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthiness. The point is to not try to throw ourselves away and become something better, its about befriending who we are already.<br/><br/>The ground of practice is you or me or whoever we are right now, just as we are. That\'s the ground, thats what we study, that\'s what we come to know with tremendous clarity and interest.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},

    {q:'I can\'t overestimate the importance of accepting ourselves exactly as we are right now, not as we wish we were or how we ought to be',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'We think that if we just meditated enough or jogged enough or ate the perfect food, everything would be perfect. But from the view of someone who is awake, that\'s death. Seeking security or perfection, rejoicing in feeling confirmed and whole, self-contained and comfortable, is some kind of death. It doesn\'t have any fresh air....The essence of life is that it is challenging.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},

    {q:'Every day of your life, every morning of your life, you could ask yourself, “As I go into this day, what is the most important thing? What is the best use of this day?” At my age, it’s kind of scary when I go to bed at night and I look back at the day, and it seems like it passed in the snap of a finger. That was a whole day? What did I do with it? Did I move any closer to being more compassionate, loving, and caring—to being fully awake? Is my mind more open? What did I actually do? I feel how little time there is and how important it is how we spend our time.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'We’re always in some kind of mood. It might be sadness, it might be anger, it might be not much of anything, just a kind of blur. It might be humor or contentment. In any case, whatever it is, that’s the path.<br/>When something hurts in life, we don’t usually think of it as our path or as the source of wisdom. In fact, we think that the reason we’re on the path is to get rid of this painful feeling. In this way, we naively cultivate a subtle aggression against ourselves. However, the fact is that anyone who has used the moments, days, and years of his or her life to become wiser, kinder, and more at home in the world has learned from what’s happening right now. We can aspire to be kind right in the moment, to relax and open our heart and mind to what is in front of us right in the moment. Now is the time. If there’s any possibility for enlightenment, it’s right now, not at some future time.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'The idea of karma is that you continually get the teachings you need to open your heart.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'Welcome to the present moment as if you had invited it. It is all we ever have so we might as well work with it rather than struggling against it. We might as well make it our friend and teacher rather than our enemy',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'When you feel tired you should not force yourself to meditate upon something. When you meditate you should just rest in the natural state. The nature of mind is the conscious awareness that recognizes all mental arisings. This conscious mind is like pure water. The mental arisings are like earth. If your awareness is weak the water mixes with the earth and becomes muddy. This muddy mind is unbearable and people therefore commit suicide. Your awareness must prevail with clarity, then you will not cling to the mental arisings. If you just leave them be they are like a pebble in water, if you cling to them they are like earth making your mind cloudy.<br/><br/>Thus do not cling to your thoughts, do not grasp at their reality. This life is like a dream. Do not believe in its reality. Preserve the conscious knowing awareness and let go of thoughts, then they will not affect you. Habituate the natural state. At times pray to Tara and recite her mantra. Tara should appear in your mind, then ordinary fixations will subside. If the thoughts do not mix with your mind, they are not harmful even if they arise. If you do not grasp at them they are rendered powerless. If you grasp at them they will wear you out. The actual mind can not be tired, the fixation to thoughts make you weary.',a:'Garchen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Honestly, unless we cultivate that sense of noticing when being distracted, there is only distraction, nothing else. This is what we call "the black diffusion of samsara" where there is only ignorance, never any knowing of what the essence actually is. For a samsaric person this black diffusion is continuous.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If one has the confidence and ability to mix one’s mind with that of one’s teacher, then even if the two are separated for many years and cannot meet in person, one can experience the wisdom of one’s Guru, just as it is, through pure devotion combined with practice.',a:'Dudjom Sangye Pema Shepa'},
    {q:'It is so basic in us to feel that things should go well for us, and that if we start to feel depressed, lonely, or inadequate, there’s been some kind of mistake or we’ve lost it. In reality, when you feel depressed, lonely, betrayed, or any unwanted feelings, this is an important moment on the spiritual path. This is where real transformation can take place.<br/><br/>As long as we’re caught up in always looking for certainty and happiness, rather than honoring the taste and smell and quality of exactly what is happening, as long as we’re always running away from discomfort, we’re going to be caught in a cycle of unhappiness and disappointment, and we will feel weaker and weaker. This way of seeing helps us to develop inner strength.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'If we want there to be peace in the world, then we have to take responsibility when our own hearts and minds harden and close. We have to be brave enough to soften what is rigid, to find the soft spot and stay with it. We have to have that kind of courage and take that kind of responsibility. That’s true spiritual warriorship. That’s the true practice of peace.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'We think the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem, but the truth is that things really don\'t get solved. They come together and fall apart',a:'Pema Chödrön'},

    {q:'In the monastery of your Heart,<br/>you have a temple<br/>where all Buddhas unite',a:'Milarepa'},
    {q:'Each person\'s life is like a mandala- a vast, limitless circle. We stand in the center of our own circle, and everything we see, hear and think forms the mandala of our life. We enter a room, and the room is our mandala. We get on the subway, and the subway car is our mandala, down to the teenager checking messages on her iPhone and the homeless man slumped in the corner. We go for a hike in the mountains, and everything as far as we can see is our mandala: the clouds, the trees, the snow on the peeks, even the rattlesnake coiled in the corner. We\'re lying in a hospital bed, and the hospital is our mandala. We don\'t set it up, we don\'t get to choose what or who shows up in it. It is, As Chogyam Trungpa said, "the mandala that is never arranged but is always complete." And we embrace it just as it is.<br/>Everything that shows up in your mandala is a vehicle for your awakening. From this point of view, awakening is right at your fingertips continually. There\'s not a drop of rain or a pile of dog poop that appears in your life that isn\'t the manifestation of enlightened energy, that isn\'t a doorway to sacred world. But it\'s up to you whether your life is a mandala of neurosis or a mandala of sanity.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'We hear a lot about the pain of samsara, and we also hear about liberation. But we don\'t hear much about how painful it is to go from being completely stuck to becoming unstuck. The process of becoming unstuck requires tremendous bravery, because basically we are completely changing our way of perceiving reality, like changing our DNA. We are undoing a pattern that is not just our pattern. It\'s the human pattern: we project onto the world a zillion possibilities of attaining resolution. We can have whiter teeth, a weed-free lawn, a strife-free life, a world without embarrassment. We can live happily every after. This pattern keeps us dissatisfied and causes us a lot of suffering.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'When we start to meditate or to work with any kind of spiritual discipline,we often think that somehow we\'re going to improve, which is a subtle aggression against who we really are. It\'s a bit like saying, "If I jog I\'ll be a much better person." "If I had a nicer house I\'d be a better person." "If I could meditate and calm down I\'d be a better person." Or the scenario may be that we find fault with others. We might say, "If it weren\'t for my husband I\'d have a perfect marriage." "If it weren\'t for the fact that my boss and I can\'t get on, my job would be just great." And, "If it weren\'t for my mind, my meditation would be just excellent."<br/>But loving-kindness (maitri) towards ourselves doesn\'t mean getting rid of anything. Maitri means that we can still be crazy, we can still be angry. We can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthiness. Meditation practice isn\'t about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better. It\'s about befriending who we are already.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'Now you may be interested in Dharma, have so called devotion or emotion towards teacher. Thinking maybe you’re practising Dharma: by having a mala on your hand, carrying a prayer book wherever you go, offering butter lamp so forth. But I must tell you please use your time to practise proper Dharma. Know your mistake. Do not hide your mistake. Improve yourself. By the merit of Dharma, blessing and advice of your teacher, by your determination and devotion for the path of liberation.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If there are whole parts of yourself that you are always running from, that you even feel justified in running from, then you’re going to run from anything that brings you into contact with your feelings of insecurity. And have you noticed how often these parts of ourselves get touched? The closer you get to a situation or a person, the more these feelings arise. Often when you’re in a relationship it starts off great, but when it gets intimate and begins to bring out your neurosis, you just want to get out of there. So I’m here to tell you that the path to peace is right there, when you want to get away.',a:'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q:'Look at the real nature of the harm that is done to you. It is as elusive as a drawing on water. Let your resentment subside by itself. When the stormy waves of thoughts have vanished, the mind becomes like the cloudless sky that has nothing to win or lose.',a:'Shechen Gyaltsab'},
    {q:'Faith opens the door to the Dharma. <br/>Diligence forms their central pillar.<br/>Practice is their final conclusion. <br/>Who gathers these three is the best Buddhist practitioner.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'This is what the path of Dharma is like. It\'s not that you have to do all the practices. It is sufficient to take just one of them, whichever one you really have an affinity with, and through practicing that one alone, for the rest of your life, you will achieve enlightenment. Whichever practice you choose doesn\'t matter; they are all valid methods for achieving enlightenment—if you practice. The key is to practice with diligence for the rest of your life.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Most people never question their day-to-day experiences. They accept whatever is felt and perceived as real. Without examining anything we will never penetrate beyond this illusion to see the actual state of affairs. Instead, we will regard everything that is impermanent as being permanent, what is unreal as being real. What an unfortunate, superficial and mistaken way of perceiving things!',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In brief, whatever is dawning, be right there with an uncontrived mind. Do not involve yourself with stopping, or starting, or with any modification whatsoever. Whatever arises, stay uncontrivedly right with that arising. Don’t reel your mind in, don’t cast around for an object of meditation out there. Be right there with the meditator, your very own mind. Unfound when sought, your own mind is primordially empty mind nature. Seeking also is unnecessary; the seeker — yourself — is that [which one is seeking]. Unwaveringly remain right with that very seeker.',a:'Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The root of suffering of ourselves and all others is self-grasping. When two people have love and treat each other with love, any form of anger will be eliminated. Someone who receives love will be happy and joyful. Love arises when self-grasping is absent, but when self-grasping is present, love cannot arise. Love is like the sun, it alleviates everyone\'s suffering and fears. It is the inseparable union of self and others that simultaneously accomplishes the highest purpose for self and others. So we can understand love to be both for our own benefit and for the happiness of others. Where does this love arise from? It arises from bodhicitta; it arises from the buddhas.',a:'Garchen Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The Difference Between Faith (Tepa) and Devotion (Mogu). Tepa is actually love - loving your lama, liking your lama, and trusting your lama, etc. This is the experience of Tepa. Mogu is when you see the wonderful qualities of your lama and generate a great deal of respect for him or her to such an extent that you will never forget anything the lama teaches you. When you have so much trust, love and devotion to the lama, you will always remember his or her words. Tepa and Mogu may seem to be similar, yet they are different.<br/><br/>First, we have Tepa, and out of this, we are able to generate Mogu. We have Tepa - faith, trust, and respect - for all lamas. Mogu, however, we have for just a few. Tepa basically means liking someone, but it is much more than that. You like someone because that person is not ordinary. That person is full of blessings; there is something holy and sacred about that person. When you are struck with this kind of feeling toward a sublime being to the extent that even the bodily hairs stand on end, when you have that kind of Tepa. There is a mind-to-mind connection with your root lama and the previously arisen Tepa is now transformed into Mogu. Tears come to your eyes. This is not like the Tepa in the earlier days, but rather there is mind merging with mind.',a:'Garchen Rinpoche'},

    {q:'What is the sign that someone has received the teachings of the supreme Dharma and is practicing them? Whoever has heard and absorbed the teachings becomes serene and self-possessed. Ours is not a tradition that inculcates anger and encourages us to fight; it does not encourage us to get involved with our defiled emotions. On the contrary, the Buddha has taught us to get rid of our defilements as much as possible. The point is that, having received the Dharma teachings, we should find when we examine ourselves, that, even though we may not have been able to eradicate our defilements totally, our anger has at least diminished a little. We should find that, even if we do get angry, we are less involved and are able to keep ourselves in check. This is the sort of sign we should be looking for. The sign that we are assimilating the teachings is an increase in serenity and self-control. It is said that if practitioners do not examine themselves frequently, and if they fail to practice correctly, the Dharma itself will lead them to the lower realms. Some people claim to have received the teachings, but they don’t practice them. On the other hand, it is obviously impossible to eradicate defiled emotion just by listening to the teachings. We have been in samsara from beginningless time and are immersed in the habits of defilement. These cannot be whisked away by the mere act of listening to something. So turn inward and examine your minds. You should at least have a glimmer of understanding!',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Genuine compassion comes from the fact that you see your own limitations: you wish to be kind and you find that you aren\'t kind. Then, instead of beating yourself up, you see that that\'s what all human beings are up against and you begin to have some kind of genuine compassion for the human condition. And you see how challenging it is to be a human being. You try to be peaceful and never raise your voice and you find out you have a lot of rage. The Dharma is about making friends with the groundlessness and discomfort of those feelings. It is not about making rules so that those emotions never arise...',a:'Pema Chodron'},
    {q:'The reason why we find so much discussion of epistemology, or how to define something as a valid cognition, in Buddhist writings is because all our problems, suffering and confusion derive from a misconceived way of perceiving things.<br/>This explains why it is so important for a practitioner to determine whether a cognitive event is a misconception or true knowledge. For it is only by generating insight which sees through delusion that we can become liberated.<br/><br/>Even in our own experience we can see how our state of mind passes through different stages, eventually leading to a state of true knowledge.<br/><br/>For instance, our initial attitude or standpoint on any given topic might be a very hardened misconception, thinking and grasping at a totally mistaken notion. But when that strong grasping at the wrong notion is countered with reasoning, it can then turn into a kind of lingering doubt, an uncertainty where we wonder: "Maybe it is the case, but then again maybe it is not". That would represent a second stage.<br/><br/>When further exposed to reason or evidence, this doubt of ours can turn into an assumption, tending towards the right decision. However, it is still just a presumption, just a belief. When that belief is yet further exposed to reason and reflection, eventually we could arrive at what is called 'inference generated through a reasoning process'.<br/><br/>Yet that inference remains conceptual, and it is not a direct knowledge of the object. Finally, when we have developed this inference and constantly familiarized ourselves with it, it could turn into an intuitive and direct realization--a direct experience of the event.<br/>So we can see through our own experience how our mind, as a result of being exposed to reason and reflection, goes through different stages, eventually leading to a direct experience of a phenomenon or event.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'We do not ever have to invent or create emptiness, as it has always been the nature of all phenomena. We just have to realize this reality.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'But what — you may ask — is it like to recognize the face of non-dual awareness? Although one experiences it, one cannot describe it. It would be like a mute person trying to describe dreams. It is impossible to distinguish between oneself resting in non-dual awareness and the non-dual awareness one is experiencing. When one rests naturally – nakedly – in the boundless state of non-dual awareness, the urgency of injudicious hyperactive conceptuality, memories, and troublesome plans – evaporates and disappears in the spacious sky of awareness. Referentiality collapses and vanishes into non-dual awareness.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The mind is not just \'oneness\' or a singular entity because it manifests in manifold ways. It is not a plurality or many things, either, because these numerous manifestations all have one essence. No one can describe its nature saying, "It is exactly like this!" It is indescribable, unutterable, inconceivable, nonarising, unceasing, and nondwelling, like the essence of space.',a:'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Put simply, to think in terms of the harm that comes to us via all sentient beings engenders hatred toward others and is based on a principal belief in selfishness. We should not think, "Oh, lots of horrible things have been done to me" and get stuck on that. Instead, if we nurture the other principle of benefiting others, then through our altruistic attitude benefit will come to ourselves too. All happiness and well-being necessarily come to us in dependence upon others. What goes around comes around, and if we do good for another, then good will come to us. This is what we should call real benefit and profit. It is very important that we place this principle in the forefront of our mind, making this kind of profit our priority and considering our long term goals in this way.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Dharma is not a ritual; it is not something you do only with your body and speech. Dharma is actually something that transforms your mind. For example, if we are aggressive or angry, then we may look inside and try to find reasons why we should not feel that way. We instruct ourselves, we try to change it, and then slowly, we become less angry. That is what we actually mean by Dharma practice. You do not need to find special time for this kind of Dharma practice. You can do this form of practice even while you engage in your profession, your work',a:'17th Karmapa'},

    {q:'A practitioner must develop mastery of his or her energies, and in the Dzogchen teachings there are practices to make this mastery possible, practices to suit all kinds of birds and all kinds of cages. But one must know for oneself what kind of bird one is, and what kind of cage one is in. And then, one must really want to come out of all cages, because it’s no good just making one’s cage a little bit bigger or more beautiful by, for example, adding some fascinating bars made from some ‘exotic’ Tibetan teaching. It’s no good building a new crystal cage out of the Dzogchen teachings. However beautiful it might be, it’s still a cage, and the whole purpose of the Dzogchen teachings is to take one out of all cages into the expanse of the clear sky, into the space of the primordial state.',a:'Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche'},
    {q:'In inviting sentient beings as guests, the bodhisattva, the practitioner in the mahayana, has a constant sense of the impermanence of the relationship — the guest is going to leave. So we view this as an opportune time, and there is constant appreciation. Our guests come. We entertain them and relate with them. Afterward, the guests thank us, we say good-bye, and we go back to running our home. There is a sense of the preciousness and the impermanence of the relationship, a sense of that relationship being extremely special. Our guest may be our husband, our wife, or our child — everybody is the guest of everybody.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'All success, great and small, whether in spiritual or temporal affairs, derives from your stock of merit. So never neglect even the slightest positive deed. Just do it. In the same way, don\'t dismiss your little faults as unimportant; just restrain yourself! Make an effort to accumulate merit: make offerings and give in charity. Strive with a good heart to do everything that benefits others. Follow in the footsteps of the wise and examine finely everything you do. Do not be the slave of unexamined fashions. Be sparing with your words. Be thoughtful rather, and examine situations carefully. For the roots of discrimination must be nourished: the desire to do all that should be done and to abandon all that should be abandoned.<br/><br/>Do not criticize the wise or be sarcastic about them. Rid yourself completely of every feeling of jealous rivalry. Do not despise the ignorant, turning away from them with haughty arrogance. Give up your pride. Give up your self-importance. All this is essential. Understand that you owe your life to the kindness of your parents. Therefore do not grieve them but fulfill their wishes. Show courtesy and consideration to all who depend on you. Instill in them a sense of goodness and instruct them in the practice of virtue and the avoidance of evil. Be patient with their little shortcomings and restrain your bad temper, remembering that it only takes the tiniest thing to ruin a good situation.<br/><br/>Do not consort with narrow-minded people, nor place your trust in new and untried companions. Make friends with honest people who are intelligent and prudent and have a sense of propriety and courtesy. Don\'t keep company with bad people, who care nothing about karma, who lie and cheat and steal. Distance yourself, but do it skillfully. Do not rely on people who say sweet things to your face and do the reverse behind your back.<br/><br/>As for yourself, be constant amid the ebb and flow of happiness and suffering. Be friendly and even with others. Unguarded, intemperate chatter will put you in their power; excessive silence may leave them unclear as to what you mean. So keep a middle course: don\'t swagger with self-confidence, but don\'t be a doormat either. Don\'t run after gossip without examining the truth of it. People who know how to keep their mouths shut are rare. So don\'t chatter about your wishes and intentions; keep them to yourself. And whether you are speaking to an enemy, an acquaintance or a friend, never break a confidence.<br/><br/>Be welcoming with people, and smile and talk pleasantly. And keep to your position. Be respectful towards your superiors, even when things do not go well for them. Don\'t scorn them. At the same time, don\'t bow and scrape before the vulgar, even when they are proud and full of themselves.<br/><br/>Be skillful in not making promises that you know you cannot keep. By the same token, honor the promises you have made, and never dismiss them as unimportant. Do not be depressed by misfortune and the failure to get what you want. Instead be careful to see where your real profit and loss lie.<br/><br/>All such worldly conduct, adopted with proper discrimination, will result in this life\'s fortune and prosperity and, so it is said, a speedy passage to the divine realms.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When one realizes one is dead, one should observe the six recollections, such as remembering one\'s practice and yidam.<br/>If an individual knows how to recognize mind essence and does not have any broken samayas it will be possible to take birth from the bud of a lotus flower in one of the five emanated buddha fields, in the five directions.<br/><br/>If one has broken samaya, the experience at this time will be like walking in darkness, as if in thick mist. One will be totally lost.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Aspire not only to understand the Dharma intellectually, but to understand it experientially.<br/><br/>Aspire to embody ultimate and relative bodhichitta, so that it’s not just your good looks, knowledge and political clout that attract and magnetize sentient beings.<br/><br/>Aspire to create connections with people - even those who catch no more than a glimpse of your brightly coloured T-shirt in a crowd - that result in the seed of Dharma being sown in their minds.<br/><br/>Aspire that your body, your bearing, your ideas and thoughts all, in one way or another, become beneficial to sentient beings. For example, if I suddenly had an urge to check the state of the stock market, may that mundane thought mature into a beneficial manifestation.<br/><br/>Aspire never to be reborn into the family of a billionaire, as such circumstances would mean you only see a rosy picture of the world and deprive you of the wealth of understanding the Dharma.<br/><br/>At the same time, aspire to become President of the United States, or of China or Russia, so you can skilfully benefit sentient beings with the powers that job brings you.<br/><br/>Aspire to become a prostitute in a seedy red-light district of a major city, and for bodhichitta to be born in the minds of anyone with whom you become acquainted.<br/><br/>Aspire to practice the Dharma thoroughly and completely and pray that you will not always be waiting for the right time to start practising. When you have time, go somewhere quiet and practise.<br/><br/>Aspire never to put off practising what you already know because you want to gain more intellectual Dharma knowledge.<br/><br/>Aspire to experience sadness.<br/><br/>Aspire always to take the right direction, however ignorant you may be.<br/><br/>Pray that when you chase after meaningless desires, the object of your desire will lead you to benefit sentient beings.<br/><br/>When you lose your temper, may you feel embarrassed at your behaviour and gain some realisation.<br/><br/>When you feel depressed, may that very depression be the cause for you to realise the truth.<br/><br/>And most important of all, always aspire to aspire.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Now the time has come when the earth is scowling at us; the time has come when the earth is giving up on us. The earth is about to treat us badly and give up on us. If she gives up on us, where can we live? There is talk of going to other planets that could support life, but only a few rich people could go. What would happen to all of us sentient beings who could not go? What should we do now that the situation has become so critical? The sentient beings living on the earth and the elements of the natural world need to join their hands together—the earth must not give up on sentient beings, and sentient beings must not give up on the earth. Each needs to grasp the other’s hand.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Unless one is omniscient or at least enjoys some degree of clairvoyance, no one can judge others. One can see how others appear and how they are behaving, but not who they are or why they are behaving in a particular manner. For example, enlightened ones such as buddhas, bodhisattvas, and sages appear in peaceful forms and wrathful forms, but all their activities will be for serving others with love. This is why the fully enlightened Buddha said, “Apart from myself and those like me, no one can judge another person.”',a:'Tulku Thondup'},
    {q:'When we think about the suffering of sentient beings together with our own suffering, we are taking on the suffering of others. This has two benefits. First, your own suffering decreases if you take on the suffering of others. Then, to eliminate any grasping at suffering, meditate on emptiness, visualize the deity, or visualize the fire of tummo and think that as your intrinsic awareness burns away your suffering, you are thus relieved. The suffering of yourself and others will truly be eliminated, as there is only one suffering. This suffering is collected into one mass and then burned away by the fire of intrinsic wisdom awareness, the union of emptiness and compassion.',a:'Garchen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Be respectful, kind, beneficial and affectionate to all Dharma friends. Never harbour bad intentions, anger or deceit towards them, nor inflict harm upon them. Regard Dharma friends as your vajra brothers and sisters. Do not slander them. Do not gossip divisively about either your Dharma friends or other practitioners and teachers. Do not harm your own practice by indulging in impure perception. Extend pure perception as much as you can.<br/><br/>A genuine yogin or yogini has unrestricted pure perception. Do not restrict your pure perception to your own root-guru alone. Acknowledge the timeless enlightened quality in each and every being.<br/><br/>Vajrayana in general is training in pure perception – Dzogchen is even much more so. How can you call yourself a practitioner of Dzogchen if you spend your time defaming, finding fault with or criticizing others?<br/><br/>Maintain the view of pure sight, sound and awareness. This is how samsara and nirvana actually are, pervaded by the three kayas or three vajras. Sentient beings might not be aware of their Buddha Nature, but they are nevertheless endowed with the three kayas. You need to train in pure perception by accepting and respecting the three kayas in everyone.<br/><br/>Great masters perceive all sights, sound and cognitive activity as infinite purity. Once recognition of awareness is stabilized, there is no more impurity to be perceived. Train in this by thinking: “As the Buddha Nature pervades all beings, not a single being is unsuitable.” The more you respect Buddha Nature in others and train in pure perception, the more your own practice will progress.<br/><br/>Slandering beings is slandering Buddha Nature; stop doing that. If due to your own impurity you perceive mistakes in other beings, at least do not voice them. If your awareness practice is too weak to sustain pure perception naturally, try to develop a rapport within an intellectual understanding of Buddha Nature in others.<br/><br/>Know that your impure perception of others only happens either because you have not recognized genuine awareness, or because that recognition is not developed. Criticizing and slandering others puts you out of tune with the enlightened essence. You mainly harm yourself. The most unrealized so-called practitioner of Dzogchen can at least keep his or her mouth shut, even if he or she cannot actually maintain the view.<br/><br/>A deceitful person views everybody with suspicion and finds many mistakes in others. A pure person naturally perceives others to be good. How much more so does a perfect yogin or yogini. He or she has the perception of infinite purity. They will actually perceive all forms as the bodies of the deities, all sounds as mantra, and all thoughts and emotions as the display of awareness. In their perception of pure sight, sound and awareness there is no attachment to friends or aversion to enemies. Awareness itself being free from concepts of good and bad, proper and improper, they perceive everything as great equanimity. They do not accept or reject friends or foes. They perceive not the tiniest speck of impurity.<br/><br/>As is said, “Arriving at a golden island, one cannot find ordinary earth or stones even if one searches for them.” In general, good and bad are your own perception, so you cannot possibly see faults in others when your own are purified.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Have you noticed the further we learn about Buddhism, do preliminary practice etc, we start to lose the main part of Buddhism? We focus so much on this or that practice, totally forget about basic good human being, compassion, Bodhicitta, discipline, 4 noble truths... Many of us like to cover ourselves, pretend to be calm and good. But our mind doesn’t really practise. That’s why I really rejoice when I see good practitioners. They don’t have to be Lamas or Rinpoches. They may be a simple monk, yogi or lay practitioner. They not only practise within themselves, even outwardly, represent such practice - simplicity, humbleness, genuineness, selflessness.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we engage in the practice of refuge but we don’t have the arising of authentic love, it will bring very little benefit. Whenever we even think about our spiritual guide we should have the arising of so much love and devotion that tears come to our eyes. Whenever we have this kind of strong authentic devotion it is considered a sign of heat, heat generated in the mind that is powerful enough to melt the ice of this mind that is fixed through the habits of negative emotions.<br/>Thus we should meditate on loving-kindness, devotion, and compassion again and again until this sign of tears arises. In Dzogchen teachings it is said that to have this kind of authentic arising of devotion, so much so that one begins to cry, at that moment one can catch a glimpse into the true nature of the mind. We should make effort then to practice compassion until we actually reach the point of tears.',a:'Garchen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It may sound as if you must have devotion in order to have an understanding of the view, that devotion ignites the practice of the Dharma. But as you become more seasoned in practicing the Dharma, especially the Vajrayana, the gap between devotion and the goal of the devotion becomes very small.<br/>As you become more skilled in practicing, you will see that devotion is the awareness of impermanence, devotion is the renunciation mind, devotion is the compassion for all sentient beings, devotion is none other than the experience of dependent arising.<br/>Most important, the moment there is devotion, you have the view, and there is awareness of shunyata.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Some of us imagine there will come a point when we can give up our samsaric activities and worldly duties completely and devote our time to the Dharma, but Jigme Lingpa pointed out that such a time will never come.<br/><br/>It’s not that you must cease all worldly activity and only practice the Dharma but rather that you should train yourself to remember that your worldly activities don’t come to an end. He is saying that you shouldn’t kid yourself into believing that at some point in this lifetime you won’t have anything else to do. With this procrastinating attitude—imagining that there will be an end to our activities—we may never begin to practice. Samsaric endeavors are endless and fruitless; samsaric activities never end.<br/><br/>So whenever and wherever devotion arises spontaneously, use it. Don’t imagine you will be able to practice later using that moment of devotion as your inspiration, because by the time you practice, the devotion will have been exhausted.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Vajrayana is not Difficult…<br/>But we make it difficult. Much of the difficulty is sparked by the “rumors” of those people who struggle with what—when you examine it—comes down to just one point. That one point is resistance to actualizing what you thought was your motivation. And of course that is difficult. Because at some point, the dharma must be powerful enough to completely sever all familiarities: familiar attachments, habitual ways of thinking, and the familiar ways you color those projected thoughts. It means your familiar ways of articulating labels, and your ways of defining, characterizing, and exaggerating concepts. These are extremely difficult things to let go of.<br/><br/>On the one hand, you do understand being kind, being selfless, and being able to rest in the nature of mind—all of these things are good. But you don’t actually see that in order to be kind, to practice selflessness, or to rest in your own true nature, simultaneously there must be a giving up of that familiar way you think; the way you articulate; the way you designate or label thoughts; and the way you allow the characteristics of a concept to proliferate.',a:'Jetsün Khandro Rinpoche'},

To help ease any lingering pain, visualise them in the place of honour, and as you arouse bodhichitta, wish them everything that is good. If thinking about them continues to be painful, it is a sign that you have not let go of feeling they have wronged you. Try not to focus on it. Instead, admit to yourself that you are still holding on to your pain. Then concentrate on wishing them every happiness and long to take all their sufferings on yourself.

Be respectful toward your superiors, and even when things do not go well for them, don’t scorn them. At the same time, don’t bow and scrape before the vulgar, even when they are proud and full of themselves.<br/><br/>Be skillful: do not make promises that you know you cannot keep.

    {q:'"It is not enough merely to look into the space of happiness or sadness; it is important to have pure presence constant in that flow. If the power of meditation is not constant, it is impossible to remain long in the place of nondual perception. Thoughts that arise intermittently will break the continuity, and radiating out from this, like ripples on a pond, the poisonous taste of emotion will arise to obstruct the meditation. As gross thoughts increase, ripples become rough waves that intensify the emotion. Until subtle emotions are left behind, we cannot eradicate suffering, so it is crucially important to sustain the state of meditation. When we gain strong familiarity by staying in that space for a long time, then no matter what thoughts arise, whether gross or subtle, they will not be able to dislodge us: upon recognizing the first thought, whatever thought it may be, in that very moment, we realize it to be the play of the spontaneous creativity of dharmakaya. Like a wave falling back into the ocean, the thought vanishes into the dharmakaya. In that space of naked empty pure presence that is the view, always cherishing thoughts of the five poisonous emotions and all the movements of body, speech, and mind, and the acts of eating, sleeping, moving, and sitting, we are known as the yogins and yoginis who stand guard over the shifting dharmakaya display. This is the supreme method of sustaining the essence of meditation. According to Dzogchen teaching, this is unadulterated by any kind of focus; it is called “the great meditation that is nonmeditation.”',a:'Tulku Pema Rigtsal'},
    {q:'Thinking of self-importance has become a very strong habit. In order to change it, we need to refocus. Instead of concerning ourselves with "I" all of the time, we must redirect our attention to "you" or "them" or "others."<br/><br/>Reducing self-importance lessens all of the attachment that arises from it. When we focus outside of ourselves, we will eventually realise our shared equality with all other beings. Everybody wants happiness, and nobody wants to suffer. Our desire for our own happiness will then expand and become a desire for the happiness of all.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},

Someone who receives love will be happy and joyful. Love arises when self-grasping is absent, but when self-grasping is present, love cannot arise. Love is like the sun, it alleviates everyone\'s suffering and fears. It is the inseparable union of self and others that simultaneously accomplishes the highest purpose for self and others. So we can understand love to be both for our own benefit and for the happiness of others. Where does this love arise from? It arises from bodhicitta; it arises from the buddhas.',a:'Garchen Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The great vidyadhara Jigme Lingpa said that it is very important to analyze the guru first. As I said before, we are naturally very insecure people. Because of this we are easy prey. We make all sorts of mistakes that are difficult to clear up later on.<br/><br/>Before you start to follow a guru, you should have a good understanding of the dharma. I don’t mean that you have to understand it completely, but at least you should have some understanding. You should analyze, and you should be skeptical and critical. Perhaps you should argue, and try to find fault by using logic and reflection.<br/><br/>But while you are doing this, you should not have the journalist’s approach of looking for faults. The aim here is to find the path, not to find faults. So, when you study Buddhism, you should try to see whether this path suits you or not, whether this path makes sense or not. This is very important.<br/><br/>Here’s an example. Let’s say that we want to go to New York, and we are hiring a guide. We need to have at least some idea where New York is. To take a guide without knowing whether New York is in the east, south or west is what I call the “inspirational disease.” It’s not enough just to find the guide attractive—to like the way he looks, talks and behaves. You should have at least some knowledge where New York is, so that if in the middle of the trip he begins to act a little funny, you feel okay because you know that you are heading in the right direction. He may lead you through strange or rough roads, but that doesn’t matter if you know you are heading in the right direction.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you don’t know the way at all, you are obliged to place all your trust in this one guide who claims that he can do anything. Maybe if you have lots of merit, you might accidentally find an authentic guide and actually reach New York. But if I were you I would not trust this kind of accidental success all the way. It is good to analyze the path first, and then you can have one or a hundred or thousands of gurus if you like.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'One of our main tasks as human beings is to seek and to discover what is real and true. We must use intelligence as our main tool and sound reason as the verifier. That is all we have at this point. However, as we go about deepening our understanding, we still carry one problem with us: this mind that reasons so intelligently is still basically confused. Therefore, every “insight” is saturated by confusion. I am sorry to say it so bluntly, but human understanding is confused. It is not unmistaken wisdom, and it is not authentic until complete enlightenment. Can we admit that we are not yet enlightened?<br/><br/>The awakened state of a Buddha is one of perceiving clearly, distinctly and completely the nature of things and all that exists. It is a wisdom that knows things as they are without confusion, without distortion. This is why we ordinary human beings cannot avoid seeking support in the words and teachings of a Buddha.<br/><br/>Today we see a heightened interest in the Buddha’s teachings throughout the world; there is a lot of contact between people of various backgrounds and the traditional teachings of the Buddha. It is my impression that Westerners who are new to Buddhism often feel more comfortable with a teacher who is well versed in psychology or science — even one who has only a cursory understanding of what the Buddha taught — than with a well-educated Buddhist master. It is human nature to prefer ease and dislike hardship, and catering to this attitude will always be popular. Those who want to adapt their teachings to people’s weaknesses and brand it “Buddhism” will likely become popular leaders of a new movement. New followers will exclaim, “Your style is so free and open — I like it!”<br/><br/>I cannot, at present, say whether this is good or evil; it is merely an observation. Just the same, if we are concerned with a Buddhism of authentic value, I would suggest that we give center stage to the Buddha surrounded by the great masters of the lineage. Actually, I consider this of vital importance for the future of the dharma.<br/><br/>My main point is that the original words of the Buddha are very important. Even during Nagarjuna’s time, a climate of debate and counter-arguments prevailed in India, and some Buddhists accused him of distorting the Buddha’s words. The same thing happened to Padmasambhava. That is why we should give the original words of the Buddha special emphasis.',a:'Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Many people try to find a spiritual path where they do not have to face themselves but where they can still liberate themselves--liberate themselves from themselves, in fact. In truth, this is impossible. We cannot do that. We have to be honest with ourselves. We have to see our gut, our real shit, our most undesirable parts. We have to see that. That is the foundation of warriorship and the basis of conquering fear. We have to face our fear; we have to look at it, study it, work with it, and practice meditation with it.',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Let’s think about how we can practice authentic dharma. Is it difficult? If we want to practice the real thing, we must abandon mundane samsaric activities completely. We should stay in a secluded mountain, not think about anything related to the eight worldly concerns. If the worldly things decline, we should feel happy. This is how we can practice authentic dharma. But the fact is we are not able to practice like this. However, we should realize that this is how those great masters in the past practiced. We should come to understand how to practice authentic dharma.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Complete openness, \'Zangtal\' in Tibetan, means not attached to anything, not fixating on anything. This is precisely the opposite of an ordinary person\'s frame of mind clinging to and fixating on everything. The openness of Rigpa, the openness of a yogi, does not fixate on anything: it does not hold on to anything. We need to grow used to this type of openness. Let your five senses be wide open, wide awake and yet thought-free. Remain in that state, utterly open.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Tantric practitioners are not really worshipping a guru because of his personality, his achievements, his charisma, or his reputation. It’s nothing personal at all.<br/><br/>A tantric practitioner has to see everyone as the guru. Not only that, a tantric practitioner has to see everything as the guru’s form, every sound as the guru’s voice, and every thought as the guru’s mind.<br/><br/>So eventually all your idealizing, sycophanting, and ass kissing of a guru will mature so that you will do that to everyone, even those who irritate you the most, and everything that enters your consciousness.<br/><br/>When that starts to happen, you are beginning to subdue and outshine appearance and existence instead of existence and appearance subduing and outshining you, which is probably what is happening in your experience of phenomena now.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you experience suffering, you must give rise to courage and not become discouraged. Meditating on the yidam or reciting mantra will keep you from becoming discouraged.

    {q:'I often tell practitioners, especially beginners, that no one can learn everything there is to know about how to do the ngöndro correctly and then start to practise. It is only possible to know everything, including how to perform all the rituals correctly, once the practise has been completed and fully accomplished.<br/><br/>Inevitably, therefore, you will constantly make mistakes, large and small, and it is through these mistakes that you learn. No language student imagines they can learn the entire vocabulary and grammar of a new language in one go, then immediately speak it perfectly. We pick up language as we go along, make mistakes, stumble over words here and there and improvise. Eventually, though, everything comes together and suddenly we find we are fluent.<br/><br/>Dharma practise follows a similar pattern, and most of what we learn comes to us through the mistakes we make as we practise.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that between starting to practise and the achievement of your first real taste of dharma will be a lengthy period of intense effort. But once you have experienced that first taste, you will be able to practise in every situation, in all the corners of the world and with every conceivable kind of person. And not only will you relax in yourself, but you will no longer sit in judgment on others for not practicing “properly.”',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The main point is that if we are going to be real practitioners of the dharma, then we need to become independent practitioners, people who actually know how to practice by learning how to be quite direct and honest with ourselves. We might think we can always be sitting in front of our teacher or master and practice the dharma by continually receiving advice from him or her about what we should and should not do. But if we are always in need of advice, then someone who can give us advice is not always going to be there for us.<br/><br/>Therefore, we have to learn how to pay attention to what is going on in our own minds and figure out what are our faults, and what are our qualities, and what is the way to distinguish between faults and qualities. Instead of constantly looking to something that is outside of us, we have to develop the ability to pay attention in a mindful way and an insightful way to what is actually happening within us, so that we can become capable, autonomous practitioners of the dharma.',a:'17th Karmapa'},

    {q:'If your intention is not clear, if you aren’t really weary of samsara, then going on retreat is just another game. Even if you stayed for your whole life, you would just be wasting time and you would not learn anything. Many animals spend their lives in caves or in the ground like groundhogs, just eating and shitting without practicing Dharma. The Buddha said that people who go on retreat without first understanding real Dharma have the solitude of a demon’s hook. The same is true for those who understand Dharma but have no intention of benefiting sentient beings, just wanting to go from samsara’s suffering to samsara’s vacation. When people who have spent time in solitude without understanding come out of retreat, only hair, beards, and fingernails are longer; otherwise, everything is the same. When they come out, they have more ego than before and they boast about their accomplishments with saintly pride or siddha arrogance.',a:'Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Abisheka is an exclusively tantric method. Ultimately, abisheka is an introduction or an unveiling. If you wake up with amnesia and someone comes to inform you who you are, what your role is, and what you can claim as yours, it’s important that this person be trustworthy and the information accurate. Receiving the information is like receiving an abisheka, and the informant is like the guru. It’s important that the guru knows what he’s doing.<br/><br/>Over time “abisheka” has become almost synonymous with “blessing.” Abishekas do have an element of blessing, but the core purpose of the abisheka is to remove the veil that has prevented you from recognizing your true nature.<br/><br/>There are many kinds of veils, but for the sake of simplicity, we speak in terms of the three veils: the veil of body, the veil of speech, and the veil of mind. Interestingly, these three are also referred to as the three gates. In the Vajrayana they are called the three indestructible vajras: vajra body, vajra speech, and vajra mind. This last set of labels refers to the absolute reality of body, speech, and mind, which needs to be unveiled and discovered.<br/><br/>To the student who has a good grip on bodhichitta, who has prepared with a foundation of basic mind training, like lojong, who has a good under-standing of interdependence, and especially who has a strong conviction in the tantric path and devotion to the guru, the guru will give abishekas at the appropriate time and place.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you want to be really, really happy, it isn’t enough just to space out in meditation. Many people who have spent years alone in meditation have finished up the worse for it.<br/>Coming back into society, they have freaked out. They haven’t been able to take contact with other people again, because the peaceful environment they created was an artificial condition, still a relative phenomenon without solidity.<br/>With bodhicitta, no matter where you go, you will never freak out. The more you are involved with people the more pleasure you get.<br/>People become the resource of your pleasure. You are living for people. Even though some still try to take advantage of you, you understand: ‘Well, in the past I took advantage of them many times too.’ So it doesn’t bother you.<br/><br/>Thus bodhicitta is the most perfect way to practice dharma, especially in our twentieth-century Western society. It is very, very worthwhile.',a:'Lama Yeshe'},

    {q:'All difficulties come from not thinking of others. Whatever you are doing, look constantly into the mirror of your mind and check whether your motive is for yourself or for others. Gradually you will develop the ability to master your mind in all circumstances; and by following in the footsteps of the accomplished masters of the past, you will gain enlightenment in a single lifetime. A good mind is like a rich ground of gleaming gold, lighting up the whole sky with its golden radiance. But if body, speech, and mind are not tamed, there is very little chance that you will achieve any realization whatsoever. Be aware of your thoughts, words, and actions at all times. If they take the wrong direction, your study and practice of the Dharma will be of no use.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When the disciples of Adzom Drugpa practised giving and taking, or tonglen, as it is called in Tibetan, they would do so thinking especially of people who had committed many heavy, negative actions. And it often happened that if they had previously gained some experience in meditation, their understanding would become clouded and they would feel that their obscurations had increased. Should signs like this occur, however, they are not to be taken as indications that future suffering is in store for us.<br/><br/>Throughout his life, Geshe Karak Gomchung prayed, \'May I be reborn in hell in place of those who have accumulated sinful actions.’ He would repeat this prayer day and night. But just before he passed away he said: \'My prayers have not been fulﬁlled! For it seems that I am going to Dewachen; wherever I look, I see gardens full of ﬂowers and a rain of blossom. Though I have prayed that all beings might go to Dewachen and that I myself might go to hell instead of them, in fact it seems that I am not going.’<br/><br/>Such are the results of tonglen.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Since the benefit of beings is the foremost goal, there is no absolute necessity that everything we say in our teachings be in line with Buddhist philosophical doctrines.<br/><br/>This is so because it is possible for some students not to receive much benefit from presentations given strictly on the basis of traditional Buddhist philosophies and ideas. One must use all the means at one’s disposal – be they Buddhist or non-Buddhist – to benefit others. This means that for bodhisattvas there are a lot of things to learn. There is nothing that does not become an area of study for a bodhisattva.<br/><br/>The reason why we have to study in so many areas is because we have to cater to the various needs, interests, and abilities of many different people. For this reason, bodhisattvas must not only have a good heart: they must also have vast intelligence.<br/><br/>Whatever major or minor methods there are for accomplishing happiness there are in the world, we must have respect for all of them. Not only must we respect them, we must learn and engage in those methods when appropriate.<br/><br/>Whether they are from the Dharma or the mundane world, we must pay attention to and study all skillful methods available. We might think that some methods, since they do not fit snuggly with Buddhist philosophies, are useless and to be abandoned. However if we abandon them we will only be doing so because those methods do not seem suitable for use, not because of our concern for others. This is unacceptable.<br/><br/>Therefore we must remember that it is important to be inclusive as a teacher. Being capable of thinking in this way is an indispensable quality for a bodhisattva.',a:'17th Karmapa'},

    {q:'In our ordinary experience we are overwhelmed by countless dualistic perceptions and conceptions. Every day we are attracted to pleasurable objects and repulsed by unpleasant ones. Burdened with a narrow idea of who we are, we spend our time running toward this and away from that. This deeply ingrained habit of viewing things dualistically and believing in our dualistic discriminations leads to nothing but confusion and repeated dissatisfaction. But it is possible to cultivate a completely different view of reality. Fed up with the endless rat-race of our compulsive cyclic existence, we can train in penetrative awareness and cultivate a direct perception of the actual way things exist.',a:'Lama Yeshe'},
    {q:'For beginners, given the weakness of their antidotes and their difficulty in countering afflictions that have already arisen, they must relinquish them first through their conduct.<br/><br/>As for meditation, it is said that each affliction has a corresponding antidote. Since whatever meditative practice we undertake from among the three scopes becomes a remedy against all the afflictions, it is appropriate to engage in this practice.<br/><br/>As our mental level advances, since afflictions are devoid of objects, it is sufficient simply to recognize that this is so. Thus there remains nothing to eliminate.<br/><br/>Śāntideva states:<br/><br/>Afflictions! Afflictions! Relinquish them with your eyes of insight.',a:'Thubten Jinpa'},
    {q:'The practice of Mahamudra and the practice of the Trekcho aspect of Dzogchen are both concerned with looking at the nature of mind. Both of these teachings provide precise, practical instructions on how to do this. In the broadest sense, the nature of our mind is not just the nature of our mind; it is the nature of all things, external and internal. We need to realize the nature of all things or all phenomena in order to overcome or transcend our bewildered and confused projections. Nevertheless, in practice, we emphasize viewing the nature of our mind because by looking at the mind, it is easy to see this empty nature directly, which is not true of looking at external phenomena. Furthermore, it is most important to resolve that this empty nature is the nature of our mind because our mind is the source of all our experience and therefore of all our suffering. If we realize the nature of mind, we overcome all suffering. Shantideva provides us with this analogy: if we are barefoot and want to walk on ground covered with sharp rocks and thorns, we can choose to cover the entire path with leather or we can put leather on just the soles of our own feet. It obviously would be far easier to simply cover the soles of one\'s feet with leather by wearing shoes. In a similar way, looking at the nature of our own mind is like wearing shoes and covering the world with leather is like looking outside ourselves for happiness. Therefore Mahamudra and Trekcho are primarily concerned with mind.',a:'Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Anything is possible in emptiness.',a:'Garchen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Newcomers to Buddhism occasionally ask me what it feels like to be awakened. I don’t know, but I think it must be a sense of deep satisfaction and fulfillment due to knowing reality. To use an analogy: When we are ignorant about something, we feel uncomfortable and try to understand it. Once we have understood it and that obstacle is lifted, we feel tremendous relief. We feel pleased because we are fully confident that our understanding is correct. When we become fully awakened, we will directly realize that all exists, so imagine the deep satisfaction we will experience then. This gives us an idea of the mental joy a buddha experiences.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'If with a pure heart you do something helpful for other people, they suspect you must be trying to fool them.<br/><br/>If you speak out truthfully, you are bound to highlight people’s shortcomings-and no one likes that.<br/><br/>Instead, you had better keep your true worth concealed, like live embers buried under the ashes.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When our hands rub two sticks together, that produces a fire that will eventually cease, but this fire does not come from anywhere to the sticks when it first begins to burn them, and does not go anywhere when it goes out. Fire is empty of coming and going.<br/><br/>Similarly, ignorance, clinging to the belief in self, mental afflictions, and suffering do not come from anywhere and they do not go anywhere.<br/><br/>We can apply this to the experience of dreams as well and see that whatever appears in dreams, whatever happiness or suffering, it does not come from anywhere and it does not go anywhere. In the very same way, all phenomena are empty of coming and going.',a:'Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you practice meditation, if you get pissed off or discouraged when you find you are distracted, then you don\'t know why you are meditating.<br/><br/>First, see the conditions of your discontent in life/why you aren\'t happy, then you will start to see all your negative emotions. When you look deeper, you will see the negative emotions arise from the judgement thoughts of "I, me, my". If you can clearly see that the "I" is the trouble maker, then you can gradually convince yourself to train to reduce the "I", and this is the very purpose of the path of meditation.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Even if you are sharing the spiritual journey with other people, those other individuals’ experience is different, totally different, in terms of how the journey really affects them. So it’s a lonely journey. There is no support, no specific guideline. You may have been told to do this and do that, but that is just the beginning—so that you know how to be lonely.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Although we use words such as achieving, wishing, and praying for enlightenment, ultimately we don’t acquire enlightenment from an external source. A more correct way to put it is discovering the enlightenment that has always been there. Enlightenment is part of our true nature. Our true nature is like a golden statue; however, it is still in its mold, which is like our defilements and ignorance. Because ignorance and emotion are not an inherent part of our nature, just as the mold is not part of the statue, there is such a thing as primordial purity. When the mold is broken, the statue emerges. When our defilements are removed, our true buddhanature is revealed.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The greatest achievement is selflessness.<br/>The greatest worth is self-mastery.<br/>The greatest quality is seeking to serve others.<br/>The greatest precept is continual awareness.<br/>The greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything.<br/>The greatest action is not conforming with the world\'s ways.<br/>The greatest magic is transmuting the passions.<br/>The greatest generosity is non-attachment.<br/>The greatest goodness is a peaceful mind.<br/>The greatest patience is humility.<br/>The greatest effort is not concerned with results.<br/>The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go.<br/>The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances.',a:'Atisha'},

    {q:'If you have no contentment, you are poor no matter how much money you have. So decide that you have enough, and rid yourself of yearning and attachment. It’s a rare person indeed who knows that wealth is passing and unstable, and who can practice perfect generosity. Even for those who do practice it, generosity is often soiled by the three impurities and is wasted, like good food mixed with poison.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Do not consort with narrow-minded people, nor place your trust in new and untried companions. Make friends with honest people who are intelligent and prudent, and have a sense of propriety and courtesy. Don’t keep company with bad people who care nothing about karma, those who lie and cheat and steal. Distance yourself, but do it skillfully.<br/>Do not rely on people who say sweet things to your face and do the reverse behind your back.<br/>As for yourself, be constant amid the ebb and flow of happiness and suffering. Be friendly and even with others. Unguarded, intemperate chatter will put you in their power; excessive silence may leave them unclear as to what you mean. Keep a middle course: don’t swagger with self-confidence, but don’t be a doormat either.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},

    {q:'All these experiences of pleasure and pain, are not brought about by anyone but yourself. They are produced by your own actions, good and bad. Once you know this, it is crucial that you act accordingly, without confusing what should be adopted and abandoned.

    {q:'You often feel lonely, but there is no need. Your true, everlasting Sangha friends are always with you: the dakas and dakinis, the peaceful and wrathful bodhisattvas, and the other Sangha of the three vehicles. They can guide you out of worldly agitation and confusion. When you realize this you will never miss friends or feel alone. Meditate; go within: that’s where your real friends are.',a:'Lama Yeshe'},
    {q:'In a state without thoughts, without distraction, abandon the watcher.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'To sum up, we need devotion to enlightened beings and compassion for those who are not. Possessing these two, what is then the main training? It is maintaining nondistraction. When we forget mind essence and are carried away, the demon of distraction lies in ambush. But with devotion and compassion, the practice of recognizing mind essence will automatically progress. Many people come to me saying, "I\'ve tried to meditate for years, but nothing happens; I\'m not making any progress." This is because of not using the effective method, the right means. We may have the knowledge aspect of having recognized mind essence, but without combining it with means of trust and compassion, we will not make any headway. We may know how to assemble and drive a car, but if we don not have the necessary parts we will never be able to ride anywhere.<br/><br/>Please keep this teaching at the very core of your heart; not at the edge or to one side of your heart, but at the very center. Please think, "That old Tibetan man said devotion and compassion are essential. I\'ll keep that right in the center of my heart." I have wanted to say this for a long time, but I feel that now people are more willing to listen. It\'s because it\'s extremely important that I felt it should be said repeatedly.<br/><br/>I am telling you the truth here. I am being honest with you. I am not lying. If you practice the way I have described here, then each month and year will yield progress. And in the end, no will be able to pull you back or prevent you from attaining enlightenment.',a:'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q:'One way to understand moods is that they are just the habit patterns of our mind continually playing themselves out in different scenarios. According to the view of Dharma, we don’t need to understand them or consider them so much as we need to replace them with new habits. This is where practice comes in. When we practice, we involve our body, emotions and mind in a new habit which is much more “real” in the sense that it is in line with the reality of enlightenment. This is the definition of purification.<br/>The problem with paying much attention at all to emotional states is that we must on some level believe that they are real if we are considering them at all. We reinforce our sense of egoic reality by examining and exploring them, much in the way Narcissus was enamored of his reflection. When we come to practice from that place, we create extra obstacles and encounter even greater resistance.',a:'Adzom Paylo Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Genuine compassion is egoless. It is the inherent essence expressed, inseparable from awareness. This natural essence, which is genuine compassion, does not need to be formulated or even expressed as something like “compassion.” We see this exemplified in our great teachers. Their genuine compassion does not require phrases and expressions or even actions. Just their presence, who they are, is nothing other than the quintessence of compassion. We, in contrast, have to invent and demonstrate compassion. Our contaminated compassion still requires effort and deliberation. That is conventional or general compassion. The good thing about the use of deliberate or conventional compassion is that it matures the mind so that ego- grasping diminishes. It definitely has that effect and is therefore a skillful method for developing awareness compassion.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'How do we actually practice tonglen? First we think about our parents, or our friends, or anybody who has sacrificed his or her life for our benefit. In many cases, we have never even said thank you to them. It is very important to think about that, not in order to develop guilt but just to realize how mean we have been. We always said, “I want,” and they did so much for us, without any complaint.<br/>I’m sure you have a lot of stories about how badly you treated your parents and friends, who helped you so much. They dedicated their entire being for your sake, and you never even bothered to say thank you or write them a letter. You should think of the people who cared for you so much that they didn’t even look for confirmation. There are many people like that.<br/>Sometimes somebody comes along out of the blue and tries to help you completely. Such people do everything for you—they serve you, they sacrifice themselves, and then they go away without even leaving an address or a number to call. All along there have been people who have done things for you. You should think of those situations and work them into your tonglen practice.<br/>As your breath goes out, you give them the best of what is yours in order to repay their kindness. In order to promote goodness in the world, you give out everything good, the best that you have, and you breathe in other people’s problems, their misery, their torment. You take in their pain on their behalf.<br/>That is the basic idea of relative bodhichitta practice. It is a very action-oriented practice. We give as much as we can give, we expand as much as we can expand. We have a lot to expand because we have basic goodness, which is an inexhaustible treasure. Therefore we have nothing at all to lose and we can receive more, also.<br/>We can be shock absorbers of other people’s pain all the time. It is a very moving practice — not that I’m saying we are all in a train, particularly. The more we give our best, the more we are able to receive other people’s worst. Isn’t that great?',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Another question is that if you always remain humble then others may take advantage of you and how should you react?<br/><br/>It is quite simple: you should act with wisdom or common sense, without anger and hatred. If the situation is such that you need some sort of action on your part, you can, without anger, take a counter-measure. In fact, such actions which follow true wisdom rather than anger are in reality more effective.<br/><br/>A counter-measure taken in the midst of anger may often go wrong. Without anger and without hatred, we can manage more effectively.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'If you can truly dedicate your life in the morning to numberless sentient beings it will bring incredible joy and happiness all day long.',a:'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We blame and criticize others because we don\'t like suffering. But if we don\'t like suffering, we should not harm others and create disharmony; this is what interferes with our happiness. What we want and what we are doing are opposite.<br/><br/>Of course, this doesn\'t mean one can\'t point out others\' mistakes at all. But when you do, as much as possible do it with loving kindness and compassion. For the sake of others, one can point out mistakes and make suggestions—this is how you discuss and communicate according to Dharma. This way there is no danger for oneself; one doesn\'t create negative karma, which throws oneself over the precipice of the three lower realms.',a:'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'As I have encountered the Dharma in this life,<br/>And from time to time been interested in practising it,<br/>I must have accumulated some merit during my past lives.<br/><br/>Throughout this life I have admired, been inspired by,<br/>And, on occasion, had the courage to emulate my master,<br/>So I must have gathered a little more merit.<br/><br/>Though shallow, my trust in the Three Jewels is absolute,<br/>And I am convinced that they alone will not mislead me –<br/>Surely a sign of their unfailing blessings.<br/><br/>From time to time I am moved<br/>By the teachings of the Buddha and his followers,<br/>Which must mean that, at some point, I’ve done something right.<br/><br/>Now and then, when required to make an offering,I feel ashamed of my own miserliness,<br/>And so the Dharma must have entered my mind to some extent.<br/><br/>As, once in a blue moon, I catch myself trying to impress others,<br/>My random condemnation of ego must have had some effect.<br/><br/>Although the feeling is rare and short-lived, I have empathized with those who are destitute,<br/>So, however seldom, I must have some heart.<br/><br/>By the power of all this merit and virtue,<br/>May I not attain enlightenment<br/>Until every other sentient being has reached enlightenment before me.<br/><br/>By the power of the merit of not wanting enlightenment<br/>Ahead of all other suffering beings,<br/>May I not become enlightened<br/>Until everyone else has reached enlightenment before me.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you are not contented with few possessions, as long as one “need” after another arises, the deceptive demon of your pleasures will enter without much trouble. Do not take as true anything others say, good or bad: Do not regard it with hope or fear; do not affirm or deny it. Allow others to say whatever they like, as if they are talking about a corpse. Except for a qualified Lama, no one can give correct advice, not even your father or mother. Be the judge of your actions and do not let others lead you around by the nose.',a:'Dudjom Rinpoche'},

    {q:'The practice of recognizing the mind will weaken your afﬂictive emotions, strengthen your compassion and [your] devotion to your teachers and lead you to see the nature of your own mind.<br/><br/>Progress in your practice depends on devotion. With great devotion, there will be great progress. If you see your teacher as enlightened, you will receive the blessings of an enlightened being. If you see him or her as an ordinary being, you will get the blessing of an ordinary being. If your teacher does a negative action and you only see him or her as enlightened, you can only receive blessings.<br/><br/>The mind of the teacher and the mind of enlightened beings are connected, even if the teacher is not fully enlightened. It is like electricity and a wire. When the connection is made, there is light. The teacher and the student are also connected like that. So, it is important to practice with devotion to the teacher. It is also important to make practice a habit.<br/><br/>You should practice at all times by working with emotions. You should graduate from observing the smaller emotions when you are relaxed, to observing stronger emotions. When you have succeeded in doing this, your ability to see the nature of mind will be like a raging ﬁre and emotion will be like grass which only feeds it. Naropa said that once you are well trained, you will not grasp after appearances. Good or bad things will happen but they will pass you by.<br/><br/>Obscuration has no form that you can see. Still, there are countless layers of obscuration. All these layers are removed by conﬁdence in the law of cause and effect and by practice and devotion to the root guru. These will dispel obscurations no matter how strong.<br/><br/>Obscurations will lessen and the nature of the mind, which is like a clear diamond, will shine forth. Then, there needs no effort to see it. It will shine effortlessly. Reading the life story of Milarepa will lessen your obscurations - so will the practice of Chenrezig, or chanting the mantra of the guru.',a:'Garchen Rinpoche'},

What we must do therefore is to strive and persevere and never give up.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'If you want to practice dharma, you have to show some determination. You have to give up the idea of “a comfortable dharma practice”. If you want to practice dharma, you should have fewer desires, and observe contentment. You should be satisfied with what you have owned. Don’t say anything like “It is not okay if my house is not fancy.”, “It is not okay if food is not delicious.”, “It is not okay if I don’t have a cushion for meditation.”, “It is not okay if I don’t have good clothes”, “It is not okay if all those things are not good”….When we practice dharma, we have to abandon a bit of those thoughts.',a:'Yangthang Rinpoche'},

    {q:' When we become jealous, we are not willing to see the positive qualities of others. Whether we are alone or in a group, when we are overcome by jealousy our eyes are not willing to see the good things in others; they are constantly looking for other’s faults. We build up intolerance toward the faults of others. In particular, when we see others enjoying good fortune that exceeds our own, we cannot stand it. In this way, we create extra and superfluous difficulties for our minds to deal with.<br/><br/>A better approach would be to pay more attention to our own conduct than to the conduct of others.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'To accomplish these purposes we need a sincere practice of the Dharma, and for this we need a proper understanding of the Dharma, proper teachings and the blessings of the unbroken lineage of the Gurus’ oral teachings. We cannot rely only on books; although an intelligent person can learn something from books, to really practice we need the blessings of the lineage. So now, out of a great rejoicing state of mind, think how you are going to receive the teachings from a Mahayana teacher.',a:'Ling Rinpoche'},
    {q:'With the realization of ones own potential and self-confidence in ones ability, one can build a better world. According to my own experience, self-confidence is very important.

    {q:'If someone is to become a true student of Dharma, that person has to know that practice is an essential part of one\'s life, intimately woven with one\'s own experience.

What’s more, your own interests will be ill served.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'The Mahayana path is like peeling layers of skin and finally finding out that there’s no seed inside. We have to obtain liberation from the skins, but this is difficult to do — we love our skins. When we’re children, a sand castle is very important to us. Then when we’re sixteen, a skateboard is very important, and by then the sand castle has become a rotten skin. When we’re in our thirties and forties, money, cars, and relationships replace the skateboard. These are all layers of skin. More important, even the paths that we practice are all layers of skin, which we use to help us peel the other skins. The inner skin helps us think about the outer skin and motivates us to peel it. But ultimately in the Mahayana path, you have to be free from all systems, all skins.<br/><br/>So what happens when all these skins have been peeled off? What’s left? Is enlightenment a total negation, like the exhaustion of a fire or the evaporation of moisture? Is it something like that? No, we’re talking about something that is a result of elimination. For example, if your window is dirty, you clean it, you wash the dirt; then the window, in the absence of dirt, is labeled a “clean” window. There’s nothing else. The phenomenon that we are calling a clean window, the quality that is the absence of dirt, is not something we produced by cleaning the dirt. I don’t think we should even call it a clean window, because the window in its original state has never been stained by the extremes of either dirty or clean. Nevertheless, the process of getting rid of the dirt can be labeled as the emergence of the clean window.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Most people suffer from being afraid of themselves, afraid of not being able to liberate the thought or emotion that is about to arise. At the moment the thought arises, they single it out as no good. You often hear that negative emotions are bad, but you don\'t know how to let them go. All these negative traits have been in you. But you can\'t not be how you are, so what do you do? For the unrealized person, there is only one solution: be depressed about it. All spiritual systems say negative thoughts are bad. You cannot find any that say negative thoughts are good. Really, are there any? Maybe some of them say that you should express them, let them out, but that is still because they know that negative thoughts are not good, that if you did not let them out you would just keep them festering inside. It is merely a different way of phrasing the same depressing information.<br/><br/>The main point is to be free of negative thought and emotion. The method of getting rid of these differ, of course. There are oceans of books written about how to do so, from both spiritual and psychological points of view. We all understand that attachment, aggression, closed-mindedness, and all the other selfish emotions make problems for people. There is a broad agreement that negative emotional states are difficult, painful, and bad because they cause problems for ourselves and for others. Everybody is in agreement about that. But how to be free, for real? That is not a settled matter. There is a lack of clarity about how to be truly free. No matter how much it is explained or discussed or thought about, the problem remains largely unsolved.

The true understanding is that the mind includes everything; when you think something comes from outside it means only that something appears in your mind. Nothing outside yourself can cause any trouble. You yourself make the waves in your mind. If you leave your mind as it is, it will become calm. This mind is called big mind.',a:'Shunryu Suzuki'},

No.<br/>I went out on my first date with my wife in New York City. You dress nicely, you smile, you talk, you gaze, you touch. This is the ritual of dating. And at the end of the night you get a kiss.<br/><br/>I met a Zen monk once. He explained to me that unlike Tibetan Buddhists, Zen didn’t use all that ritual. They went straight to emptiness. Then I had a meal at a Zen temple. Every single movement was a ritual. How you sat down, how you unfold your napkin, how you hold your bowls, how you put them down, where you place your chopsticks. Every single gesture. There was no room for choice. This was a ritual for gathering the mind.

    {q:'In 1966, a friend took me to the Atlanta Airport. When we were saying good-bye she asked, “Is it all right to hug a Buddhist monk?” In my country, we’re not used to expressing ourselves that way, but I thought, “I’m a Zen teacher. It should be no problem for me to do that.” So I said, “Why not?” and she hugged me, but I was quite stiff. While on the plane, I decided that if I wanted to work with friends in the West, I would have to learn the culture of the West. So I invented hugging meditation. Hugging meditation is a combination of East and West. According to the practice, you have to really hug the person you are holding. You have to make him or her very real in your arms, not just for the sake of appearances, patting him on the back to pretend you are there, but breathing consciously and hugging with all your body, spirit, and heart. Hugging meditation is a practice of mindfulness. “Breathing in, I know my dear one is in my arms, alive. Breathing out, she is so precious to me.” If you breathe deeply like that, holding the person you love, the energy of your care and appreciation will penetrate into that person and she will be nourished and bloom like a flower.',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},

What struggles and thirsts is the aggregate of fabrication (sankhara). If you latch on to fabrication, that\'s the essence of suffering — big-time suffering.

    {q:'What is keeping me away from what I want to do as a practitioner? We must ask ourselves this question. Great practitioners of the past would not have the distractions that we have, however noble these aims of ours seem, because those practitioners took impermanence so deeply to heart.<br/><br/>So we must address honestly all the attachments that keep us distracted. And if we look, with attachments there is always a sense of being bound to a burden, again, however noble. This is not about getting rid of our attachments; nor do we plan to. It\'s OK to have attachments; we all do.<br/><br/>But as a responsible practitioner, we must look at our attachments in the context of the precious human birth, impermanence, and what we would like to accomplish as a practitioner. Then make aspirations and contemplate how we want to use the time ahead.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We tend to think of the Buddha as someone with great powers – a kind of Superman with superpowers who will come to protect us and save us when something terrible happens. But who is the real superhero? You are. Superman is not the Buddha. You are. Who is your protector? You are. What is your greatest power? It is the power of your noble motivations. Karmic cause and effect teaches us that each one of us is a person with tremendous power to change the world. Therefore, you should value yourself and trust in your own abilities. This is a key point in order to be able to take up great responsibilities, through your noble aims and intentions.<br/><br/>For this reason, we should not always be expecting something outside ourselves to intervene, as if we were entreating the buddhas and bodhisattvas, “Please bless me so that good things happen to me.” We make continual requests to the teacher or lama to grant us their blessings. But sometimes the lama’s battery is finished! So many people want to recharge from the lama that even the biggest battery can run down. There are also people who did something good in the past and now expect something good to be done to them.<br/><br/>I think it is very important not just to wait for the external buddhas and teachers. We also need to understand that we have an inner Buddha or an inner teacher. That means we need to be the ones who make the effort. We need to create the opportunities, or produce the good energy, without always waiting for someone to arrive and intervene from the outside. I think it is very important to produce this by yourself, because, actually, you are the Buddha. Not such an effective buddha, perhaps, but... a buddha, a small Buddha. Our Buddha is like a child, not yet grown up enough to do more, so we need to nurture our inner Buddha, our child Buddha.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Solitude is extremely important, especially for calm abiding or shamatha meditation. […] But actually, outer solitude is not as important as inner solitude, since all disturbances come from within. Therefore, it is more difficult to find inner solitude. We create our own crowd of thoughts that jostle our mind. Since they are within us, these distractions are not easily banished. Though difficult to find, inner solitude is the most important thing; outer solitude alone is not enough. Please try to find real solitude.',a:'17th Karmapa'},

    {q:'Unless you are a yogi like Milarepa you should definitely plan and prepare as if you are going to live another 50 or 70 years or whatever; you should plan that way. But in you, you really should know that that might not be the case. And not only that, we should not only think of our impermanence, but also everything else. Any kind of situation, you name it, everything is impermanent. That way it is about everything.<br/>So how do we handle this? I say take a deep breath and take it easy. The most important thing is to do your best with every moment of your life. Be good, sincere, kind, honest and hard working. If you are meditating, meditate well, if you are doing something, do it well. Do your best in every moment. That is how to take care of the understanding of impermanence. If you just sit there and worry that you might die in the next hour, that’s not the best use of the understanding of impermanence. Make the best out of your lives, even if you are going to die in the next hour you will not have any regret if you have done your best. That is how to handle it.',a:'Tai Situ Rinpoche'},

The commitment is to refrain from speech and action that would be harmful to ourselves and others and then to make friends with the underlying feelings that motivate us to do harm in the first place.

    {q:'Use the Dharma that you have studied to change your mind, to be different from before.

    {q:'This is my own practice, and I frequently speak about it to others.<br/>Imagine that in front of you on one side is your old, selfish \'I\', and that on the other side is a group of poor, needy people.<br/>And you yourself are in the middle as a neutral person, a third party.<br/>Then, judge which is more important - whether you should join this one selfish, self-centered, stupid person or these poor, needy, helpless people.<br/>If you have a human heart, naturally you will be drawn to the side of the needy beings.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},

    {q:'Living a life with joy is meaningful. Wisdom and compassion play crucial roles. Wisdom helps foster humility. Reduction in ego-centricity is part and parcel of humility. There is automatically more focus on the wellbeing of others. It is not putting ourselves down. There is no one to be put down; there is no one to perform the action of putting down; and there is no action of putting down! These are only concepts and not real. There is strength and courage stemming from this deeper wisdom that we are not who we think we are. It is letting go of old habits of tightly embracing this old concept of who we think we are. As ego goes down, compassion automatically rises. Less spotlight on ourselves naturally shifts the focus to genuine concern for others. Wisdom and compassion are joined at the hip, just different ways to say the same thing – meaningful life of joy. Emaho!',a:'Ven. Barry Kerzin'},
    {q:'Tantric practitioners are not really worshipping a guru because of his personality, his achievements, his charisma, or his reputation. It’s nothing personal at all. A tantric practitioner has to see everyone as the guru. Not only that, a tantric practitioner has to see everything as the guru’s form, every sound as the guru’s voice, and every thought as the guru’s mind. So eventually all your idealizing, sycophanting, and ass kissing of a guru will mature so that you will do that to everyone, even those who irritate you the most, and everything that enters your consciousness. When that starts to happen, you are beginning to subdue and outshine appearance and existence instead of existence and appearance subduing and outshining you, which is probably what is happening in your experience of phenomena now.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'I realize that even though I should possess the whole world, at my death I should have to give up everything; and so it will confer happiness in this and the next life if I give up everything now. I am thus pursuing a life which is quite opposite to that followed by the people of the world. Give up thinking of me as a living person.',a:'Milarepa'},

    {q:'Samsara is not a place, it\'s not planet Earth, it\'s not human existence, it\'s none of that. Samsara is this way of being, in which we are wandering around, like a street dog, aimless, fundamentally deluded, acting out of desire and hostility. Not maturing, not fluorishing, not cultivating genuine happiness, going from one place to the next, until death finally arrives.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'Child, if you are distracted by external activities, you should focus your mind inward.<br/><br/>Child, if your meditation becomes foggy and dull, merge your awareness with the sky.<br/><br/>Child, if you are tired and bored with the practice, relax your mind in the deep nature.<br/><br/>Child, if your mind is scattered, be in a state of “single thought.”<br/><br/>Child, if your practice is increasing, there is no other commitment needed.<br/><br/>Child, if grasping obscures your view, don’t be timid about cutting it away.<br/><br/>Child, keep the Lama in your heart all the time, and all good qualities will come naturally.<br/><br/>Child, give up worldly concerns and focus on the practice.<br/><br/>Child, all the beings of the six realms are our parents; therefore, do not forsake your compassion for them.<br/><br/>Child, all the activities of this world have no meaning; therefore, don’t get carried away by them.',a:'Padampa Sangye'},
    {q:'The guru never remains outside, independent from you—breathing down your neck, watching over you, correcting you as if he or she were a superior being. We use the word “dissolution” because in our dualistically inclined minds, we like the idea of dissolving. But a better word is “merging,” like the space inside a bottle merging with the space outside the bottle once the bottle is broken.<br/><br/>In the quintessential practice of guru yoga, “yoga” has many different meanings. Yoga is like a practice. One could almost say “my daily Starbucks yoga,” or “my taking shower yoga.” It’s the thing that you do—a discipline, a method, a means—therefore, in the tantra you will hear of many different yogas: yoga of sleeping, yoga of dreams, yoga of waking up, yoga of eating, yoga of postmeditation, and so on.<br/><br/>We also use the term “yoga” for the practice of guru yoga. When we say “guru yoga,” unfortunately it always refers to some kind of sadhana, a text. You always begin with refuge and bodhichitta and visualizing the guru above your head or in your heart, depending on what sadhana you are using. This is not incorrect, but a more helpful way to think about guru yoga is to think,<br/><br/>Dwelling in the guru<br/>Dwelling in the spirit of the guru<br/>Dwelling in the atmosphere of the guru<br/>Dwelling in the aura of the guru<br/>Dwelling in the mood of the guru<br/>Dwelling in the hue of the guru<br/>Dwelling in the nation of the guru<br/>Dwelling in the world of the guru<br/>Dwelling in the universe of the guru<br/>Dwelling in the remembrance of the guru',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Humbleness comes from working with others. When you work with others, you realize the need to be patient, to give space and time to others to develop their own understanding of goodness and bravery. If you are frantic and try to push your understanding onto others, then nothing happens except further chaos. Knowing that, you become extremely humble and patient in working with others.',a:'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Our mind is a treasure. But it’s very absorbent, so we must also be very discriminating in what we hear, read, and see. And in the spiritual life, our fence is our ethics. If we know we are living ethically to the best of our ability, the mind will become peaceful.',a:'Jetsünma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'The thing we call “mind” is quite peculiar. Sometimes it is very stubborn and very resistant to change. With continuous effort, however, and with conviction based on reason, our minds can be sometimes quite honest and flexible. When we truly recognize that there is some need to change, then our minds can change. Wishing and praying alone will not transform your mind; you also need reason—reason ultimately grounded in your own experience. And you won’t be able to transform your mind overnight; old habits, especially mental ones, resist quick solutions. But with effort over time and conviction grounded in reason, you can definitely achieve profound changes in your mental attitudes.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'If you can bring your whole life to the path and practice the Dharma with as much time and energy that you have given to your worldly existence, Buddhahood will be within reach.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'We cannot simply learn and reflect and then leave out the meditation, because what it boils down to is that one needs to mix the dharma with one\'s own mind through meditation. If that does not happen, then one has missed the point.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Now we are afflicted by "me-my-mine-itis," a condition caused by ignorance. Our self-centeredness and self-important thinking have become very strong habits. In order to change them, we need to refocus. Instead of concerning ourselves with "I" all the time, we must redirect our attention to "you" or "them" or "others." Reducing self-importance lessens the attachment that stems from it. When we focus outside ourselves, ultimately we realize the equality of ourselves and all other beings. Everybody wants happiness; nobody wants to suffer. Our attachment to our own happiness expands to an attachment to the happiness of all.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When the nature of the mind is recognized, that is called Nirvana; when it is obscured by delusion, that is called samsara. Yet neither samsara nor Nirvana has ever parted from the continuum of the Absolute.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'When Awareness reaches its full extent, the ramparts of delusion will have been breached and the citadel of the Absolute, beyond meditation, can be seized once and for all.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The four boundless attitudes are thus the wish that others be happy, the wish that they not suffer, the joyful desire that they never lose their happiness, and the aspiration to view them all with an open heart free of partiality.<br/><br/>It is important to understand that the object of the practice, namely, other beings, and the form of the practice, that is to say, these four attitudes, are devoid of true existence.<br/><br/>They are like dream visions or reflections in a mirror. In other words, this training should be performed in a state that is free of clinging to a truly existent subject, object, and action.<br/><br/>By contrast, the loving attitude of wishing happiness for one’s friends and relatives out of attachment; the kind of compassion that, for instance, spares animals from toil only out of miserliness; the conceited exhilaration that comes from being more prosperous than others; and the formless, mindless indifference of wishing neither to help nor to harm — these have nothing to do with the authentic path of liberation.<br/><br/>They are more akin to the four so-called Brahmaviharas, the four attitudes that provoke rebirth in the form and formless realms. Since they approach their objects with partiality and bias, and since their character is one of clinging, they are a distortion of the four boundless attitudes of the Mahayana and should be utterly discarded.<br/><br/>In the context of the Mahayana path leading to Peace, the nonabiding nirvana beyond the two extremes, the focus of the four boundless attitudes is the entire aggregate of beings and is completely without bias. Moreover, although such beings, and for that matter the four attitudes themselves, are manifest phenomena, they are without inherent existence, being primordially beyond all conceptual construction.<br/><br/>Through repeated training, the four boundless attitudes, in which both skillful means and wisdom are combined, will strengthen and eventually give rise to relative and absolute bodhichitta. This is why they are referred to as extraordinary. They are endowed with a skill and wisdom that are not to be found among the Shravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and those who follow worldly paths.',a:'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Compassion is something really worthwhile. It is not just a religious or spiritual subject, not a matter of ideology. It is not a luxury, it is a necessity.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'In meditation, we continually rediscover ourselves as authentic human beings who are capable of loving ourselves and others as well. We are finally beginning to subjugate our intense aggression and toughness. Our tough exterior is dissolved into a compassionate jellyfish, so soothing, so soft. This realization only comes from the sitting practice of meditation. Holding your posture, following the breath, working with our thoughts: that is the only way.',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Spirituality doesn\'t exist on another level different from ordinary life.',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Becoming attached to this life, you will lose your fortunate connection to the Dharma. By indulging your desires again and again, your craving will only increase, and you will never find satisfaction. Chasing after wealth, fame and praise is like buying and selling in a dream. Let go of such concerns!',a:'Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Relax. You already have everything that you need. Your nature is already whole. Your nature is already pure. There is nothing to obtain. You just have to give up and let go what is covering it.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'All too often, though, even so-called Buddhists misunderstand bodhichitta and reduce it to little more than compassionate loving-kindness. Love, compassion and wanting to make people happy are very popular ideals these days and are often promoted as bodhichitta’s most important features. We forget that without bodhichitta there would be no mahayana or vajrayana Buddhism, and that the most crucial aspect of both these yanas is the wisdom of understanding shunyata (emptiness). Without wisdom, compassion alone is not “bodhichitta,” and vice versa; both qualities are essential.',a:'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'As a fish glides effortlessly through water, is it breathing water or is the water breathing the fish? A fish breathes by gulping water in and releasing it through its gills, thereby absorbing oxygen into the bloodstream. In a seamless cycle, the fish inhales water, water envelops fish. Who is breathing whom? We blend our mind inseparably with the teacher’s, who is none other than our own true nature, since the beginningless beginning (as my precious teacher put it). Breathing through us is the intangible subtlety of consciousness, that which persists through cycles of death and rebirth, the source-of-all-life, truth, or whatever we may name it.',a:'Lama Tharchin Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When a water drop merges with the ocean, it is indivisible from the ocean. And the one space on the outside and inside of a broken vase cannot be differentiated, but extends into a single, all-pervasive space. Likewise, in the identification within yourself of the pure awareness, the nature of your mind, there is nothing to be altered and nothing else with which to engage.',a:'Sera Khandro'},
    {q:'It\'s not the thinking mind that meditates',a:'Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'Someone asked me, “Aren’t you worried about the state of the world?” I allowed myself to breathe and then I said, “What is most important is not to allow your anxiety about what happens in the world to fill your heart. If your heart is filled with anxiety, you will get sick, and you will not be able to help.”',a:'Thich Nhat Hanh'},
    {q:'Moral concepts practiced without understanding can be the greatest of obstacles to fulfilling the Bodhisattva’s vow of uncompromising compassion.<br/>Do not cultivate virtue and renounce vice.<br/>Rather, learn to accept all things as they arise.<br/>Penetrate the essence of each experience until you have achieved the one taste.',a:'Ghantapa'},
    {q:'The location of the truth of the Great Perfection is the unfabricated mind of the present moment, this naked radiant awareness itself, not a hair of which has been forced into relaxation. Maintaining this at all times, just through not forgetting it even in the states of eating, sleeping, walking, and sitting, is called meditation. However, until you are free from the obscurations of cognition, it is impossible for this not to be mixed with the experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptualization. Nevertheless, just by not forgetting the nature of one’s own awareness — the kind that is not a tangled mindfulness that gets more tangled in order to be mindful — at some point the unelaborated ultimate truth, transcending terms and examples, will appear.',a:'Jigme Lingpa'},
    {q:'The moment you think only of yourself,<br/>the focus of your whole mind narrows,<br/>and because of this narrow focus<br/>uncomfortable things can appear huge<br/>and bring you fear and discomfort<br/>and a sense of feeling overwhelmed by misery.<br/>The moment you think of others<br/>with a sense of caring, however,<br/>your mind widens.<br/>Within that wider angle,<br/>your own problems appear<br/>to be of no significance,<br/>and this makes a big difference.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Breathing gently, people enjoy their slumber. But between one breath and the next there is no guarantee that death will not slip in. To wake up in good health is an event which truly deserves to be considered miraculous, yet we take it completely for granted.',a:'Patrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'How foolish to spend your lifetime without meaning, when a precious human body is so rare a gift. How ridiculous to cling to prison-like cities and remain there. How langhable to fight and quarrel with your wives or husbands, who do just visit you. How senseless to cherish sweet and tender words, which are just empty echoes in a dream.

    {q:'My practice is the peaceful path of kindness, love, compassion, and not harming others. This has become part of me.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'Some of you may wonder what I mean by merit. Merit is the ability to appreciate something that is positive. Merit is the ability to turn something negative into something positive. Even something really difficult. Taking this situation very positively is due to the merit. And of this merit comes the root of the training of the mind. From this point of view, merit is ability, ability.<br/><br/>So what I want to remember is that what is involved here is to change the usual reference point we have, to think that we are the most important and that people owe us something. This belief is based on considering ourselves more important. And with this we try to be happy. And we should try to find some reasons to think that we are not the most important.<br/><br/>Let\'s imagine that it is true that we are the most important. Even if we were to behave in that way, what would we get out of it? Not much. Because we cannot convince everyone. Convincing myself that I am less important than all others, instead of trying to convince everyone else that they are less important, is something that can be easily understood.<br/><br/>To be able to do this we have to think that we are less important and consider others, from the bottom of our heart, as someone very dear. In order to do this, we must watch our minds so that they do not involve emotions that bring harm to others who are so dear to us, and not to ourselves.',a : 'Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q:'You don’t have to do anything with your mind, just let it naturally rest in its essential nature. Your own mind, unagitated, is reality. Meditate on this without distraction. Know the Truth beyond all opposites. Thoughts are like bubbles that form and dissolve in clear water. Thoughts are not distinct from the absolute reality, so relax; there is no need to be critical. Whatever arises, whatever occurs, simply don’t cling to it, but immediately let it go. What you see, hear, and touch is your own mind. There is nothing but mind. Mind transcends birth and death. The essence of mind is pure consciousness that never leaves reality, even though it experiences the things of the senses. In the equanimity of the Absolute, there is nothing to renounce or attain.',a:'Niguma'},
    {q:'Great practitioners are unconceited. I tend to react with doubts towards meditators and Dharma teachers who make big productions about themselves.<br/><br/>His Holiness the Dalai Lama says that in India some people are nobody, but when they come to the West, they have five titles before and after their name, they wear big hats, and sit on high thrones. Personally speaking, I am much more attracted to the humble practitioners and teachers. I have had the good fortune to meet a number of them and they are excellent examples of what a practitioner should be - kind, generous, unassuming. They encourage others and teach them the Dharma without seeking anything for themselves. These are the people that I admire and want to be like.<br/><br/>Look at his Holiness the Dalai Lama. No matter what his status and wealth and fame, he always sees himself as a student and behaves like a student in the sense of being quite humble and really seeing himself as the servant of others. This is exactly the same kind of behavior and attitude that we should CULTIVATE.',a:'Thubten Chödrön'},
    {q:'Once you have committed to a particular path, I suggest that you look for the simplest way forward. You should make things accessible and approachable in your religious community and in your personal practice, rather than more complicated.<br/><br/>Keep it simple. The life of the spirit is actually very basic and easy. We often don’t appreciate that. In the beginning, our spiritual path may strike us as very simple and perfectly clear. But then, after we have been practicing it for a few years, we sometimes find ourselves going backward, and moving away from that initial simplicity. The spiritual breakthrough we experience may simply consist in rediscovering what we had seen in the beginning.<br/><br/>Spiritual discovery is not a matter of finding wisdom out there somewhere. It is a matter of discovering what already exists within us. Like cleaning the surface of a stone inscription, the more you clean it, the more the original carving becomes apparent. We are like that stone. With spiritual practice, instead of gaining something we did not have before, we gradually make ourselves clearer to ourselves.',a:'17th Karmapa'},
    {q:'Many people think that meditation requires a lot of effort and it’s something you have to gain. We plug into this idea that somehow it’s something we have to force ourselves to do and at the end of it we will succeed or fail. And I think it’s very important to realise it’s nothing to do with that at all. That’s just the ego wanting to be a meditator.<br/><br/>The whole secret of meditation is to learn just how to be present in the moment and in a state of complete openness and relaxation. It’s not a matter of gaining, it’s a matter of losing, of dropping — letting go, letting go, letting go. I think it’s really very important, especially in this age where we’re all programmed to want to get something that it’s not a matter of what you get, it’s a matter of what you lose.',a:'Mingyur Rinpoche'},
    {q:'What precisely is bodhicitta? It is the mind strongly characterized by the aspiration, “For the sake of all sentient beings I must attain the state of full enlightenment.” While it’s easy to repeat these words to ourselves, bodhicitta is much deeper than that. It is a quality we cultivate systematically within our mind. Merely holding the thought “I must attain enlightenment for the sake of benefiting others” in mind without first cultivating its prerequisite causes, stages and basic foundations will not give birth to bodhicitta. For this reason, the venerable Atisha once asked, “Do you know anybody with bodhicitta not born from meditation on love and compassion?',a:'Ling Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Navigating our habits and the habits of others is very difficult. Maintaining a consistent meditation practice will help you. When I say meditation, I also mean the intention and motivation you cultivate during stability practice. In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end of a meditation session, you should hold these wishes in your heart: I want all beings to have happiness; I want all beings to be free from suffering.<br/>When you meditate with this intention then the practice does not become a selfish act. I feel that meditation can be spiritual or non-spiritual. If you don’t have the intention to benefit others then I don’t feel that the practice is really spiritual. You are going to feel that something is missing.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Please be kind to each other. If there are some mistakes, give forgiveness. Everything can be repaired - it is not completely broken. Repair it - don’t leave things in a broken state. Everything is not permanent, it is impermanent. It can be repaired.',a:'Tsoknyi Rinpoche'},
    {q:'As long you have received enough teachings to practice, it doesn\'t matter if you are living far away from your guru. Some times, the distance gives better chance for the students to give rise to the devotion than the students who normally surrounds their guru.',a:'Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Mind Training should be engaged in discreetly. It should not be done with external show, in a way that attracts attention and creates a reputation; it should act as the inward antidote to our self-clinging and defiled emotions.

    {q:'The starting point for the mahayana, the path of the bodhisattva, is that you do not regard your life as boring, nor do you try to escape from your life by any means whatsoever. You do not run after entertainment or substitutions of any kind. You are honest and direct, and you face the facts of life, not only for your own sake, but for the sake of others.

    {q:'It is crucial to be mindful of death - to contemplate that you will not remain long in this life. If you are not aware of death, you will fail to take advantage of this special human life that you have already attained. It is meaningful since, based on it, important effects can be accomplished.<br/><br/>Analysis of death is not for the sake of becoming fearful but to appreciate this precious lifetime during which you can perform many important practices. Rather than being frightened, you need to reflect that when death comes, you will lose this good opportunity for practice. In this way contemplation of death will bring more energy to your practice.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'The eucalyptus trees are spreading their fragrance. The redwood groves stand tall like they have for eons. Whenever the wind blows, the branches and leaves dance gracefully. This is what you can witness in the hills by the bay. This is what we can actually see. But there are also many secret things going unnoticed, like the redwoods drinking up the fog coming in from the sea. Sometimes the fog covers the whole mountain and it feels like you are inhabiting a celestial realm, but sooner or later it dissipates. In one moment, the hummingbirds are sipping nectar. Then they are gone in a flash only to suddenly re-appear in the next moment.<br/><br/>Sometimes we don’t see people for a couple of years and when we encounter them again, we see the marks that time has left on their faces. All of this leaves us in wonderment. We ask, “What is this all about?” only to conclude that it is just life unfolding. The Buddha described it as a transient reality not to be grasped, but to be held as the sacred dance of life in all its magnificence. This sacred dance teaches us not to hold on to that which is continuously changing, but to simply be amazed by the wonder of existence.<br/><br/>When was the last time that we allowed ourselves to fully witness this magic by looking up into the expanse of the blue sky, by feeling the pulse of life in our bodies, or by listening to the sound of a creek flowing over the rocks? We don’t have to go to a special place on top of a mountain or to a holy site to experience this magic. We can be in a traffic jam, washing dishes, or doing a very ordinary thing or chore. If our hearts are open, we will feel the magic of it all wherever we are.<br/><br/>When such magic touches us, there seems to be no sense of time, past or future. The veil of internal dialogue that hides this magic from us becomes silent. We don’t have to try to stop all of our thoughts, but rather know that we can retreat into that timeless space now and then. It will give us a depth and joy we might otherwise miss in life. As a meditator, one can remember to find time every day to step out of the mental world and drop into our body and the reality of being. We can let the waves of existence wash over us while we drink from life\'s ever flowing fountains - let them wash away all of our worries and fantasies and free us of all concepts for a while.',a:'Anam Thubten Rinpoche'},
    {q:'All samsaric pleasure is like this. At the beginning it is OK, but after some time it gets boring; it is the suffering of change.

Whatever they do it is not real happiness, so they get bored and keep changing.',a:'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Hardship, in forcing us to exercise greater patience and forbearance in daily life, actually makes us stronger and more robust.

    {q:'If the warrior does not feel alone and sad, then he or she can be corrupted very easily. In fact, such a person may not be a warrior at all. To be a good warrior, one has to feel sad and lonely, but rich and resourceful at the same time. This makes the warrior sensitive to every aspect of phenomena: to sights, smells, sounds, and feelings. In that sense, the warrior is also an artist, appreciating whatever goes on in the world. Everything is extremely vivid. The rustling of your armor or the sound of rain drops falling on your coat is very loud. The fluttering of occasional butterflies around you is almost an insult, because you are so sensitive.',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Before we can extend our compassion to others, we first have to extend it to ourselves. How do we do this? We have to look at our own mind and appreciate how our own neurotic expressions – our confused thoughts and disturbing emotions – are actually helping us wake up. Our aggression can help us develop clarity and patience. Our passion can help us let go of attachments and be more generous. Basically, once we see that this mind of confusion is also our mind of awakening, we can appreciate it and have confidence in our ability to work with it. It’s a good mind after all, the mind that will carry us to enlightenment. When we understand this, we can begin to let go of our previous attitude of revulsion toward our emotions.',a:'Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche'},

If we can understand this, we can start to bring our entire life to the path.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The difference between a trained mind and an untrained mind lies in the ability of pausing, looking at that, and sensing whether it is necessary or not. An untrained mind doesn’t think at all; everything just happens. That is simply called habitual patterns.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},

    {q:'Some people may have the idea that these teachings on compassion and exchanging self and others are part of the "gradual path" teachings of the sutras, and are not nearly as effective as the more advanced "direct path" teachings of the Great Perfection or the Great Seal. That is a complete misunderstanding.<br/><br/>Only if you have developed the love and compassion of relative bodhicitta can absolute bodhicitta - the very essence of the Great Perfection and the Great Seal - ever take birth in your being.<br/><br/>If the teachings of Longchen Rabjam and Jigme Lingpa have become so widespread and have been of benefit to so many people, it is because the minds of these two great teachers were constandy pervaded with compassion and bodhicitta.<br/><br/>Jigme Lingpa\'s great disciple, Dodrup Jigme Trinle Ozer went to Kham, the eastern provinces of Tibet, and helped thousands of people there by transmitting the teachings of the Longchen Nyingthig, the Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse to them. He later wrote to Jigme Lingpa, "This could only happen because I had meditated for so long in mountain solitudes on compassion."<br/><br/>The exchange of yourself and others can be approached step by step.<br/><br/>The first stage is to see yourself and others as equally important - others want to be happy and not to suffer just as you do. So you should wish happiness for others in the same way that you wish it for yourself, and wish that they may avoid suffering, just as you do.<br/><br/>The second stage is the exchange of yourself and others; you wish that others may have your happiness and chat you may take their suffering.<br/><br/>There is a third stage, which is to cherish others more than yourself, like the great bodhisattvas who, meeting a blind person, would have no hesitation in giving him their own eyes. At that point, all selfish preoccupation has completely disappeared and you are solely concerned with the welfare of others. Keep right on with this practice until it becomes a reality.<br/><br/>Shantideva says in The Way of the Bodhisattva:<br/><br/>All the joy the world contains<br/>Has come through wishing happiness for others.<br/>All the misery the world contains<br/>Has come through wanting pleasure for oneself.<br/><br/>Is there need for lengthy explanation?<br/>Childish beings look out for themselves,<br/>While buddhas labor for the good of others:<br/>See the difference that divides them!',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Gaining mastery over our destructive propensities, through the exercise of awareness and self-discipline with regard to our body, speech, and mind, frees us from the inner turmoil that naturally arises when our behaviour is at odds with our ideals.

But on the one hand, we do not know what we should do or avoid in order to get what makes us happy.

    {q:'When you open yourself to the continually changing, impermanent, dynamic nature of your own being and of reality, you increase your capacity to love and care about other people and your capacity to not be afraid. You\'re able to keep your eyes open, your heart open, and your mind open. And you notice when you get caught up in prejudice, bias, and aggression.

You can think, for instance, \'May my body, my speech, and my mind be used in a more compassionate way, so that they become a service to others.\' This is something I usually do. It makes life more meaningful. Likewise, examine your mind in the evening before you go to bed. Review the way you spent your day, and check whether it was worthwhile.',a:'14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q:'By reciting such liturgies as the "Calling of the Guru" by Jigme Lingpa, and if you read and contemplate on the stanzas, it will at least poke some holes in the ego. And this poking a few holes in the ego\'s cocoon is what we call "the dawn of a dharma practitioner."<br/><br/>Though most of us, including myself, are not really dharma practitioners - we are dharma students. We are interested and inspired by dharma, and dharma makes sense at time, although not all the time, of course. But to be a practitioner of the dharma is entirely different from this.<br/><br/>A practitioner is someone who has seen the futility aspect of the eight worldly dharmas, or is at least attempting to give them up.<br/><br/>That is really, really, really difficult.<br/><br/>But having said this, it is not unachievable. I have definitely seen it being acheived among Westerners. With only 30 - 40 years of history in the West, the dharma is quite new, so for me, it is quite a surprise.

    {q:'A good mind is like a rich ground of gleaming gold, lightening up the whole sky with its golden radiance.

If they take the wrong direction, your study and practise of the Dharma will be of no use.',a:'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'All sentient beings are the same in wishing to be happy and not to suffer. The great difference between oneself and others is in numbers—there is only one of me, but countless others. So, my happiness and my suffering are completely insignificant compared to the happiness and suffering of infinite other beings. What truly matters is whether other beings are happy or suffering. This is the basis of bodhichitta. We should wish others to be happy rather than ourselves, and we should especially wish happiness for those whom we perceive as enemies and those who treat us badly.

    {q:'Those who become Buddhas put others before themselves. Doing so is the secret to their success on the path to enlightenment.

    {q:'Practitioners who have full conﬁdence in the Three Jewels need never worry about food and clothing. These will come their way anyway. When the sun shines in summer, it does not need to think about what it is doing— making the forests and meadows turn green, the ﬂowers blossom, and fruits ripen, and warming everyone on the earth. It does all this naturally.<br/><br/>Likewise, if you practice the Dharma sincerely, people will naturally be disposed toward you and will help you in your practice. Those who renounce the world and take ordination are naturally respected by their families and others, who are happy to support them. Those who are very learned do not have to talk about it; they easily win respect. And siddhas who have attained a high degree of accomplishment do not have to claim they are siddhas. Their accomplishment is evident and they are venerated for it. So we need not be preoccupied or obsessed with external necessities; they will come our way naturally.<br/>And in no event should we be attached to such things, otherwise we will be inﬂuenced by the eight ordinary concerns and be led into all sorts of activities in order to procure and keep them.<br/>Remember the defects of attachment to the pleasures of the ﬁve senses.<br/><br/>When we crave beautiful forms, we become like moths, which are attracted to light and get burnt by the ﬂame. However much enjoyment we may derive from the pleasures of the senses, there will never come a time when we have had enough. The more we indulge in them, the more they become like honey smeared on a razor, cutting our tongues as we try to lick it off.

But if you understand the intrinsic nature beyond change, it will not be misleading.<br/><br/>If you cling to the reality of birth and death, there is much deception. But if you realize there is no birth and death, there’s no deception.<br/><br/>If you believe in the existence of suffering, there’s much deception. But if you realize there’s no suffering, there’s no deception.<br/><br/>If you believe that self and other are separate, there’s much deception.

    {q:'It is very important to appreciate our life and rejoice in other people’s successes. We need to feel fortunate about what we have — with our companions, family, wealth, and work.

In this way, our mind becomes very positive.<br/><br/>You can be a really serious practitioner, a non-practitioner, or a medium kind of practitioner. Whatever kind of practitioner you are, it is very important to have an attitude that makes you happy and grounded. This attitude comes from seeing your life as meaningful and fortunate, from feeling very meritorious and very content, and appreciating what other people do. And also from feeling happy about what you have and feeling happy about what you are. Because when we don’t do this, our mind compares us to others and becomes competitive. Then we judge and it’s never enough. And our desire is never enough. The combination of being competitive and having a lot of desire brings a lot of unhappiness.<br/><br/>So you need to know and see. I need to see — we all need to see — that happiness, joy, and bliss come from having an appreciation of other people’s work and at the same time being content with what we have and what we are. And feeling very meritorious for whatever we are is very important.<br/><br/>Whenever the competitive mind and jealousy come up, then you need to do the work. Now, some people will think that this is very positive thinking: “We need to work with competitive companies and competitive people and we need to work harder to improve.” But my point is that our competitive and comparing mind is switched on from when we wake until when we sleep. We are always challenging others, we always want to improve, we always want something more. When is it going to end?<br/><br/>My point is that we don’t know how to make it end. We only know how to go forward and cling more. It’s never enough competing or fighting.

And after that, you can rejoice with what other people do, what other people enjoy, when they have success, and when they have a good time. Simply rejoice and feel content, no further than that.

    {q:'You need to remember death and impermanence. There is no certainty when you will die.<br/>Although one has this precious human body, it is utterly impermanent. There is no doubt we will lose it to death and resume wandering in samsara. For in samsara, all that is born will die, all that is gathered will be exhausted, all that comes together will be separated, and all that is high will fall down. Yet the time of death is quite uncertain. Moreover, the circumstances that might bring death are unpredictable. When we consider how many of the people we have met in our life are already dead, or seriously sick or suffering, we can see clearly how impermanence works. This sort of reﬂection on death will induce us to go to a lonely place and devote our lives to spiritual practice. It is why Jetsun Milarepa himself went to a deserted place and spent his whole life in ascetic practice—because he was constantly aware of the suffering and imminence of death.<br/>You need to remember that you will depart without your retinue or wealth.

If the moon did not have a shape or substance, and if it didn’t reflect the light of the sun, it would not be possible for it to appear on the water’s surface. Furthermore, the quality of clear water is that it can reflect, and when the moon and the water—two entirely separate entities—are perfectly aligned without any obstruction between them, a reflection of the moon will appear effortlessly, without intention.<br/><br/>Similarly, our inner Buddha has qualities that enable it to manifest effortlessly and without intention. When there are no obstacles, the Buddha will reflect spontaneously in sentient beings who have the merit. Some beings have the merit to enjoy the reflection of the inner Buddha in the form of the outer historical Buddha Shakyamuni, who came twenty-five hundred years ago.<br/><br/>Some have the merit to enjoy the reflection of the inner Buddha in the form of a large fish during a time of famine. For others, the Buddha may be stone statues, paintings, a lotus, a garden, or any of the other material objects that give sentient beings temporary happiness. And those with the most supreme type of merit have the ability to see nondual bliss as the Buddha.<br/><br/>The process of relating to this reflection of the inner Buddha is called devotion. As long as there is the stream of thoughts, there is no end to the projection of samsara. Until the end of samsara, there is no end to the path. As long as there is a path, there is devotion.

That kind of impediment, once it seizes you, can be difficult to overcome. You can\'t be a pampered meditator, pampered Dharma practitioner.',a:'Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Harassing ourselves with expectations is a major obstruction in our meditation sessions. The emphasis should be on relaxation, openness, and gentle but persistent effort, whatever technique we use.',a:'Dza Kilung Rinpoche'},
    {q:'For the moment what we attend to is reality. Don\'t let others select for us.<br/>We are so aware of the misery and evils in the world, balance it out by seeking out and attending to the virtues, the goodness, the happiness, the well being, the peace in the world.<br/>Engage with reality by keeping our eyes wide open for the many small, medium, and even big acts of kindness. Look for all the goodness in the world, and when you see it, attend to it.',a:'B. Alan Wallace''},
    {q:'Think of all those around the world who are dying in hospitals right now. Then imagine that you yourself are on your deathbed. You are about to lose all you have gathered through a lifetime of effort. You can\'t take any of it with you. Your friends and family surround you, but no matter how much you love or are attached to them, in a few moments you will never see them again. Imagine your terror. Then let your mind rest.<br/><br/>Next, bring your attention back to the present circumstances. You are not dying in this moment or losing those you love. You are not starving or about to be killed. Appreciate your good fortune. Again, let the mind rest.<br/><br/>Then resolve to do what you can to reduce the suffering of others. Let the mind rest. Pray that you will accomplish this, and again let the mind rest<br/><br/>Repeat this process as you imagine different circumstances in which others are suffering.',a:'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche''},
    {q:'Loving kindness is visionary. We can get bogged down, with our wheels spinning in the realm of actuality, as if that’s all that’s happening, that’s all there is. It’s pretty bleak.<br/><br/>With loving kindness self directed first of all, and then expanding like a supernova out in all directions, venturing boldly, fearlessly, into the realm of possibility and envisioning what could be, especially in terms of eudaimonia, but not overlooking hedonia: Not overlooking the possibility of everybody having enough to eat.<br/><br/>As we venture into loving kindness we lift our spirits, we become visionaries, we see the possible and we dedicate ourselves to inviting the possible, which is really a noble possibility, into the realm of actuality. Then we orient our lives towards that.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'The underlying feeling of restlessness we have now is actually a good thing: it is the expression of our sensitivity. Those who go through life without feeling uncomfortable are unconscious. The uncomfortable sensation caused by our conscience has enormous transformation potential. It is a treasure of energy that we can grab with both hands and use to build something better. Indifference leads nowhere.',a:'Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q:'The more we give our best, the more we are able to receive other people’s worst.<br/>Isn’t that great?',a:'Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If we consider that vipashyana on the nature of mind is a contemplative science, and the object of this science is the space of the mind, the space of awareness and whatever mental events arise within that space, including dreams, then vipashyana is like astronomy and shamatha is like a telescope.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'Harmful beings are everywhere, like space itself.<br/>Impossible it is that all should be suppressed.<br/>But let this angry mind alone be overthrown,<br/>And it\'s as though all foes had been subdued.',a:'Shantideva'},
    {q:'Love heals and keeps one connected to the things that matter most while anger and hatred fester and isolate. Anger causes a wound to remain fresh and putrefy and sullies those we love and hold dear by its toxicity. Whereas love allows our wounds to breath and heal, and honors the memory of all those we lost by having us remember them with that corner within our heart that represents the best within us. Love not just opens our eyes to what is good in others but also brings out that which is the very best within each and every one of us.',a:'Khandro Rinpoche'},
    {q:'When you are away from your spiritual friends, and you feel lonely on the path, and you feel a lack of encouragement to go on, just remember that all of the enlightened beings are always with you. You are never alone.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'It’s very important to recognize that it’s not other people who are annoying. It’s our mind which reacts to people doing what we don’t want and feeling upset about it. We don’t have to feel upset. That’s up to us.',a:'Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q:'The most ridiculous excuse that we exclaim in our everyday life is I do not get time to practice Dharma.',a:'Dungse Garab Rinpoche'},
    {q:'To one who does not respect a friend, there will be no value even if he knows a hundred topics.',a:'Tibetan proverb'},
    {q:'The Seven Point Mind Training begins the probe into the nature of reality using the dream analogy. Within the context of the dream there is a distinction between self and other that cannot be ignored. This is true in life and death as well. When I die, I will reap the consequences of my karma, not someone else’s. Yet, from the perspective of the awakened state we realize that the apparent distinction between self and other is a manifestation of something deeper. It is merely an illusory expression of a primordial state of awareness that transcends all distinctions between self and other. The Buddhist position is that there is a nominal truth of “I” and “you” but there is no transcendent real “I” that is independent from its label. It is the conceptual designation of “I” that evokes a referent, creating the apparent discrete qualities of entities.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'One of the saddest phrases I’ve ever heard: ‘You’re only human.’ Missing out on really what it means to be human.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'Do not predict the future based on what we’ve experienced thus far. Let your imagination soar.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'Of course it is good to look after the body, but do not forget to look after the mind.<br/><br/>Like washing away the impurities from the body, by feeding it with healthy food, wash away the impurities of ignorance, anger, and desire from the mind, by feeding it with wisdom and compassion.',a:'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Remember that judgement, of yourself or others, is the tail of ego.<br/>The more judgement you have, the more ego you have.<br/>The less judgement you have, the less ego you have.<br/>Use this to remind yourself. Over and over again.',a:'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q:'If you understand that all the misleading appearances of worldly existence are not intrinsically real, they will not tend to mislead you.<br/><br/>If you have attachment to friends and enemies as being real, they will mislead you. But if you have equanimity towards both, they will not mislead or deceive you.<br/><br/>If you see a lot of change or transition, that will tend to mislead you. But if you understand the intrinsic nature beyond change, it will not be misleading.<br/><br/>If you cling to the reality of birth and death, there is much deception. But if you realize there is no birth and death, there’s no deception.<br/><br/>If you believe in the existence of suffering, there’s much deception. But if you realize there’s no suffering, there’s no deception.<br/><br/>If you believe that self and other are separate, there’s much deception. But if you recognize that they are not two separate things, there’s no deception.<br/><br/>If you understand this true nature of deception, discursive thoughts will be liberated in their own place.',a:'Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche'},
    {q:'Develop a rich enough understanding of dharma that you have dharma for every season, dharma for every situation, that there is never any time when you do not have some type of dharma that is perfectly appropriate. Develop a rich, full understanding of dharma, do not collapse it into one particular practice. They are all wonderful, but do not be narrow, develop not only conceptually, but an experience , a practice of dharma, that is rich and diverse, that fills your whole life, like a field, completely covered with a harvest.',a:'B. Alan Wallace'},
    {q:'Someone who begins to develop an interest in the teachings can tend to distance themselves from the reality of material things, as if the teachings were something completely apart from daily life. Often, at the bottom of all this, there is an attitude of giving up and running away from one\'s own problems, with the illusion that one will be able to find something that will miraculously help one to transcend all that. But the teachings are based on the principle of our actual human condition. We have a physical body with all its various limits: each day we have to eat, work, rest, and so on. This is our reality, and we can\'t ignore it.',a:'Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche'},
