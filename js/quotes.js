    {q: 'It is always beneficial to be near a spiritual teacher. These masters are like gardens or medicinal plants, sanctuaries of wisdom. In the presence of a realized master, you will rapidly attain enlightenment. In the presence of an erudite scholar, you will acquire great knowledge. In the presence of a great meditator, spiritual experience will dawn in your mind. In the presence of a bodhisattva, your compassion will expand, just as an ordinary log placed next to a log of sandalwood becomes saturated, little by little, with its fragrance.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'As long a we take some time every day to settle our mind and reflect on the pitfalls of self-importance and the benefits of altruism, we don\'t need much more of a lojong practice than what\'s already going on in our lives. How many times a day do we interact with people, at the workplace, in our family, in our social life? If we have the motivation to step out of our small self, each interaction can be a practice of altruism. We can simply smile, listen, help others feel relaxed, soothed. There is not just one method. We can creatively turn everything into bodhisattva activity.', a: 'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Why would you invest all that energy on those plans for the future if you were not somehow blindly convinced that you are still sure to be here in this world for a long time to come?<br/>The great practitioners of the past described themselves as “yogis with the thought of impermanence implanted firmly in their hearts.” They saw clearly the futility of ordinary pursuits.

It arises through the conjunction of various factors, but there is nothing about it that can be grasped. Likewise, thoughts that arise in the mind have no tangible existence or intrinsic solidity. There is no logical reason why thoughts, which have no substance, should have so much power over you, nor is there any reason why you should become their slave.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'Slandering beings is slandering Buddha Nature; stop doing that. If due to your own impurity you perceive mistakes in other beings, at least do not voice them. If your awareness practice is too weak to sustain pure perception naturally, try to develop a rapport within an intellectual understanding of Buddha Nature in others. Know that your impure perception of others only happens either because you have not recognized genuine awareness, or because that recognition is not developed. Criticizing and slandering others puts you out of tune with the enlightened essence. You mainly harm yourself. The most unrealized so-called practitioner of Dzogchen can at least keep his or her mouth shut, even if he can not actually maintain the view.', a: 'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'The underlying sense of uneasiness that we have now is actually a good thing: it is the expression of our sensitivity. Those who go through life without feeling ill at ease are unconscious.

Indifference doesn\'t lead anywhere.', a: 'Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche'},

Nobody else can accomplish enlightenment for us or pull us into liberation. It is completely up to ourselves.', a: 'Tulku  Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Don’t boast about your guru: No matter how great you think your guru is, it would probably serve better for you to keep your devotion to yourself.

    {q: 'To put it simply, from the moment you enter the sacred Dharma and become a Dharma practitioner, your inner attitude and outer conduct should far surpass those of an ordinary mundane person. As the saying goes:<br/>"The sign of true learning is a peaceful temperament,<br/>And the sign of having meditated is fewer afflictions."<br/>If, on the contrary, your attitude and conduct are not even slightly better than an average person caught up in worldly affairs, you might consider yourself a scholar simply because you have some intellectual understanding of a few texts. Or you might think you are a perfect monk simply because you maintain celibacy. Or just because you know how to chant a few ritual texts, you might start thinking of yourself as a ngakpa. These are all just instances of blatant arrogance, and only go to show that even with the Dharma one can stumble in the direction of the unwholesome.', a: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'If we start worrying whether our nose is too big or too small, we should think, “What if I had no head? – now that would be a problem!” As long as we have life, we should rejoice. If everything doesn’t go exactly as we’d like, we can accept it. If we contemplate impermanence deeply, patience and compassion will arise. We will hold less to the apparent truth of our experience, and the mind will become more flexible. Realising that one day this body will be buried or burned, we will rejoice in every moment we have rather than make ourselves or others unhappy.', a: 'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'There are three kinds of Dharma practitioners: Firstly, there are those who look like practitioners outwardly, but inwardly they are not real practitioners. Secondly, there are those who talk very high, but have no realization at all. Thirdly, there are those who do not look like practitioners outwardly, but who are in fact genuine practitioners inside.', a: 'Chatral Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'You might ask, ‟If I have Buddha nature, why can\'t I perceive it right now?”<br/>It is because, like gold hidden in its matrix, that nature is hidden by our habits that we have accumulated since beginningless time. These habits have been created by our disturbing emotions and then reinforced by the actions that those disturbances have produced.', a: 'Shechen Gyaltsab'},
    {q: 'Practising dharma is necessarily a frustrating business. What practitioners, especially beginners, often fail to realise is that frustrations are the signposts of our success. An exasperating lack of concentration, devotion or inspiration might be just what you need to make the extra effort to tune in to your practice fully.<br/>Alternatively, of course, it may topple you in the other direction and stop you practicing altogether—a temptation you must resist at all costs.<br/>Always remember, though, that frustration with your spiritual path is often an indication that you are becoming a genuine dharma practitioner.', a: 'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'When you have truly attained the realization of this emptiness, you will be like the venerable Milarepa or Guru Rinpoche, who were unaffected by the heat of summer or the cold of winter, and who could not be burned by fire or drowned in water. In emptiness there is neither pain nor suffering. We, on the other hand, have not understood the empty nature of the mind and so, when bitten by even a small insect, we think, \'Ouch! I\'ve been bitten. It hurts!\' or, when someone says something unkind, we get angry. That is a sign that we have not realized the mind\'s empty nature.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'Genuine compassion is egoless. It is the inherent essence expressed, inseparable from awareness. This natural essence, which is genuine compassion, does not need to be formulated or even expressed as something like “compassion.” We see this exemplified in our great teachers. Their genuine compassion does not require phrases and expressions or even actions. Just their presence, who they are, is nothing other than the quintessence of compassion.<br/>We, in contrast, have to invent and demonstrate compassion. Our contaminated compassion still requires effort and deliberation. That is conventional or general compassion. The good thing about the use of deliberate or conventional compassion is that it matures the mind so that ego-grasping diminishes. It definitely has that effect and is therefore a skillful method for developing awareness compassion.', a: 'Khandro Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'The most crucial prerequisite for the practice of dharma is complete isolation, because when we are alone we are subject to fewer distractions, creating the perfect conditions for sadness to grow in our minds.<br/>For those who know how to use it, sadness is a fertile ground from which all kinds of beneficial thoughts can spring with very little effort.<br/>Jigme Lingpa described sadness as one of the most invaluable kinds of noble wealth, and in the sutras Buddha hailed sadness as the trailblazer for all subsequent good qualities.', a: 'Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Although we are responsible for what we sow, we forget that we’ve planted these seeds, and we then either give credit or blame to people or things outside of us when they ripen.<br/>In the moment, we have a thought, we speak, or we act.

    {q: 'Those who dispute intellectually, who are eager to insult other doctrines, who are clever only with words, or who refrain from only a single false activity, such as keeping their celibacy mainly out of false pride, are only protecting their vows up to the first layer of foreskin.

The view then is the primary practice. Maintaining the view for months and years, with enthusiastic effort, is called "meditation". While one is engaged in meditation, the unfailing ability to observe one\'s behavior according to cause and result is called the "conduct".<br/><br/>All dharmas, including samsara, nirvana, and the path, have no true, inherent existence whatsoever and are nothing other than the nature of utter openness, or emptiness. This type of meditation will eventually lead to the unmistaken realization of the non-duality of appearance and emptiness. Appearance does not become void, and voidness does not become appearance. Appearance and voidness are experienced in a state of non-duality.<br/><br/>When the conflicting emotions and their habitual propensities are cleared, you will be able to see that your primordial nature is perfectly pure, and that this purity is the nature of existence and the nature of each and every one of us.<br/><br/>When you are able to become free from the stain of dualistic grasping and clinging, through the practice of the view, meditation, and conduct, you will then realize the all-pervasive purity of phenomenal existence and that the primordial nature of each and every sentient being is that of a perfect buddha.', a: 'Yangthang Tulku Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'Nowadays disciples go to their masters making a request like, “Please kindly bestow an pith instruction to me!” This sounds like the masters are not allowed to give other dharma teachings, because disciples want pith instruction only.

I can’t believe he did that.’<br/><br/>Instead, we can use the method of contemplation to think things through differently, to change our habit of reacting with anger.<br/>Imagine that someone insults you. Say to yourself, ‘This person makes me angry. But what is this anger?’ It is one of the poisons of the mind that creates negative karma, leading to intense suffering. Meeting anger with anger is like following a lunatic who jumps off a cliff. Do I have to go likewise?

It means you couldn’t give up the afflictive emotions, the five poisons. You didn’t get real method or real wisdom.<br/>You don’t need to go anywhere; you already have it.

If you really think deeply about the practice of generosity, you see that it not only causes future happiness, the practice itself is instant happiness.

Some are very knowledgeable. They can explain sutra or mantra so freely. Some are very disciplined. They abide in the threefold Vows and do not violate any vow. Some are so well learned that they can teach whatever dharma to teach. And some know about how to practice dharma.

The events that occur in the narrow sphere of selfishness affect us deeply and will certainly disturb our inner peace. The situation is very different when we feel primarily concerned with others and bear in mind that they are so numerous that, in comparison, our own personal concerns are negligible.

They felt that if they didn’t bring it to mind in the morning they were in danger of wasting the entire afternoon, and if they didn’t bring it to mind in the afternoon they were in danger of wasting the whole night.

The Buddha said that people who go on retreat without first understanding real Dharma have the solitude of a demon’s hook. The same is true for those who understand Dharma but have no intention of benefiting sentient beings, just wanting to go from samsara’s suffering to samsara’s vacation. When people who have spent time in solitude without understanding come out of retreat, only hair, beards, and fingernails are longer; otherwise, everything is the same.

    {q: 'When your realization of the emptiness of all phenomena becomes as vast as the sky, your confidence in the law of causality of actions will grow proportionately, and you will become aware of the real significance of your conduct. In fact, relative truth is inseparable from absolute truth. The profound realization of the empty nature of all things has never led anyone to believe that positive actions do not create happiness and negative actions do not cause suffering.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Be ever mindful of the shortcomings of desire’s rewards, and know that all the phenomena of the cycle of existence are never still, like the ripples on a pond, and that these manifestations of delusion, which are no things in themselves, are like magic and dreams. When you have the determination to be free of samsara and are content with your material situation, you will be able to sit quietly with your mind happy and at ease.', a: 'Kalu Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'The mind is malleable: it is capable of change. So we need to learn to see how we can transform it. We need to identify the ways to achieve that transformation and put them into action. Samsara, the circle of existences, and nirvana, the state beyond it, are not like geographical locations far from one another. They are two states of mind. Samsara is a deviation from knowledge, a distorted vision of reality that makes the mind the slave of negative emotions, while nirvana is a state of inner freedom, free of any conceptual and emotional obstacles.', a: '14th Dalai Lama'},

    {q: 'Millions of people in this world are interested in some version of meditation, or yoga, or one of the many so-called spiritual activities that are now so widely marketed. A closer look at why people engage in these practices reveals an aim that has little to do with liberation from delusion, and everything do to with their desperation to escape busy, unhappy lives, and heartfelt longing for a healthy, stress-free, happy life. All of which are romantic illusions. So, where do we find the roots of these illusions? Mainly in our habitual patterns and their related actions. Of course, no one of sound mind imagines any of us would willingly live an illusion. But we are contrary beings, and even though we are convinced we would shun a life built on self-deception, we continue to maintain a strong grip on the habits that are the cause of countless delusions.', a: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

If we keep entertaining these negative acts and not believing in ourselves, thinking, “I’m not doing the practice well enough,” “I’m not capable,” “Everything is fated, so why should I try?”—at best, these acts and thoughts will divert us from our goal and slow down our spiritual progress. At worst, indulging in distractions, unwholesome activities, and negative attitudes will drag us on the wrong track and slowly lead us into the worst possible way of living, destroying all the possible fruits that this amazing human life could bring us.', a: 'Tulku Thondup'},

So we should try to perform powerful positive actions repeatedly on a vast scale.', a: 'Kangyur Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Emptiness and luminosity are not two separate things, but rather the nature of emptiness is luminosity, and the nature of luminosity is emptiness. This indivisible emptiness-luminosity, the naked mind, free of everything, dwells in the uncreated state.', a: 'Guru Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'If you’ve been practicing for years, you should be seeing some results, If you’re not, you may be missing the point.<br/><br/>The result of spiritual practice should be our inner transformation into better human beings. After practicing for months or years, we should be less prone to anger, pride, and jealousy. Our practice should lead us to a vaster, calmer mind.<br/><br/>For example, the whole point of dieting is to lose a few pounds, not to collect knowledge and become an expert on each and every diet. You may have heard about different diets and read many books, but you won’t lose weight unless you put one of them into practice in your everyday life. Similarly, if you do not implement the teachings, your destructive emotions and self clinging will not diminish, and the Dharma instructions will be of no use to you, no matter how many you receive.', a: 'Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'These days, though, just to find the time to be entirely alone to practise can be extremely problematic, especially for those with families, and so to organise the ideal place would be an unimaginable luxury. So keep it simple and do your best to be completely alone for an hour or two every day.<br/><br/>As Jigme Lingpa said, the greatest merit of all is to be able to remain alone and do nothing but practise the dharma; even an offering of the entire world and everything in it would not be enough to merit the chance of practising in isolation. He also said it is only possible to see the flaws of samsara and the benefits of nirvana in solitude. So pray from the bottom of your heart that one day you will encounter such an opportunity.<br/>Another very good reason for remaining alone is that it is so rare to meet unbiased people who compliment the dharma and harbour no envy.', a: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'Each morning after you wake up, try to shape your thinking in beneficial ways before you begin your day. You can think, for instance, \'May my body, my speech, and my mind be used in a more compassionate way, so that they become a service to others.\' This is something I usually do. It makes life more meaningful. Likewise, examine your mind in the evening before you go to bed. Review the way you spent your day, and check whether it was worthwhile.', a: '14th Dalai Lama'},
    {q: 'Suffering, in fact, can be helpful in many ways. It spurs your motivation and as many teachings point out, without suffering there would be no determination to be free from samsara. Sadness is an effective antidote to arrogance.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'To partially illustrate the nature of the mind, the analogy of space is used. The mind is likened to space because space has no shape, no color, and no characteristic. It is free from any conditioning or characteristic at all. In this way the example of space provides a suitable analogy to illustrate the nature of the mind. But there are other aspects to the mind - its radiant clarity and unobstructed compassion - that space doesn’t possess.', a: 'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'If we are serious about fostering world peace, we must first understand, generate, and experience real peace in our own mind. Awareness of peace is the foundation and goal of healing ourselves and the world. If our mind, or consciousness, is enjoying the awareness of peace, our everyday life will turn into a life of peace. Whatever we say will resound as the words of peace. Whatever we do will manifest as the expression of peace. Our mere presence will make the hearts of many blossom with happiness and harmony. Then we become one of the true peaceful members of society and a source inspiring others to true peace, too. Our every word and smile will send a genuine message of peace to others, and a true cycle of world peace and joy could be set in motion. So the inspiration of true world peace must take birth in our own heart.', a: 'Tulku  Thondup'},

He would most likely be almost completely naked; if you were lucky, he might be wearing some kind of G-string; his hair would never have been introduced to shampoo; and protruding from his mouth would quiver the tail of a live fish. What would your moral judgment be of such a being? “Him! A Buddhist?” This is how our theistic, moralistic, and judgmental minds work.

You still are what you are, but “you” is not what you are. “You” is not. That is the shunyata approach: “you” is not. You are not even a grain of sand, not even dust. You don’t exist.

You have then seen the nature of mind, resolved the basic state of reality and cut through doubts about topics of knowledge.<br/><br/>This awakened mind of awareness is not made out of any material substance; it is self-existing and inherent in yourself. This is the nature of things that is easy to realize because it is not to be sought for elsewhere. This is the nature of mind that does not consist of a concrete perceiver and something perceived to fixate on. It defies the limitations of permanence and annihilation. In it there is no thing to awaken; the awakened state of enlightenment is your own awareness that is naturally awake. In it there is no thing that goes to the hells; awareness is naturally pure. In it there is no practice to carry out; its nature is naturally cognizant.

    {q: 'Beyond meditation practice, there is attitude. A beginner must learn to cultivate what is called, “the poise of a dying man”. What is this poise? It is the poise of knowing what is important and what is not, and of being accepting and forgiving. Anyone who has ever been at the bedside of a dying man will understand this poise. What would the dying man do if someone were to insult him? Nothing. What would the dying man do if someone were to strike him? Nothing. As he lay there, would he scheme to become famous or wealthy? No. If someone who had once offended him were to ask him for his forgiveness would he not give it? Of course he would. A dying man knows the pointlessness of enmity. Hatred is always such a wretched feeling. Who wishes to die feeling hatred in his heart? No one. The dying seek love and peace.', a: 'Chan Master Hsu-Yun'},

In order to change them, we need to refocus. Instead of concerning ourselves with "I" all the time, we must redirect our attention to "you" or "them" or "others." Reducing self-importance lessens the attachment that stems from it. When we focus outside ourselves, ultimately we realize the equality of ourselves and all other beings. Everybody wants happiness; nobody wants to suffer. Our attachment to our own happiness expands to an attachment to the happiness of all.', a: 'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},

They are nothing other than the expression of the mind. This must be realized: "objective" appearances all originate from the mind.<br/>The nature of the mind is then realized or introduced to be empty, and the nature of that emptiness, as experienced in meditation, is the primordial wisdom of great bliss.

While that fleeting moment of being together still lasts, we should try to remain in perfect harmony with each other, while observing the Dharma as much as possible. Night and day, let us turn our minds toward goodness, love, and compassion. Doing a single prostration, saying a simple prayer, contemplating the nature of the mind for an instant are seeds that lead to enlightenment.

    {q: 'As a Buddhist, you have been taught that aggression is generally considered to be a negative emotion. Therefore your immediate reaction to any aggressive tendency or thought that arises in your mind will be to reject it. And you reject it because you are in love with your “self,” which makes you an egoist. As an egoist, you do not want aggressive feelings or jealousy or any of the other negative emotions to spoil your chances of becoming renowned as a “good” Buddhist. Yet according to the greater view offered by the bodhisattvayana, to reject your aggression is a weakness. To reject the bad and only accept the good shows that you are still stained by the clinging to self that we call “ego.” Instead, when a bodhisattvayana practitioner notices his/her aggressive emotions, he/she should think, “Aggression is really bad! But I am not the only one who suffers from it — all sentient beings do! So, may I take on the aggression, jealousy and pride of all sentient beings.” From a relative point of view, what happens when you take on the pens when you take on the suffering of others in this way? Fundamentally, you go against the wishes of your ego. So, if your ego wants to be the holiest and most sublime of all beings so it can boast it has no desire or jealousy, this is exactly the practice you need to do to oppose and resist it. By continually applying it, the ego becomes smaller and smaller until finally it has nowhere to live.', a: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'When we have realized that, the guru who has taught us the dharma will not be outside us anymore, but inside.<br/><br/>Where inside? The guru is the nature of our mind.

    {q: 'Desire is the source of suffering both in this life and the next. Like moths drawn to the lovely candlelight that destroys them, people are attracted to the pleasing sound of flattery, enticed by the aroma of tobacco, the taste of meat, a lover\'s soft touch, and the caress of silken robes. Thus people are deceived and destroy the path to their own freedom.<br/>Lured by the sweet sound of a lute, the deer is shot with poisoned arrows; the bee is drawn by the perfume of the flower and is ensnared in its petals; the fish is caught on the hook, unable to resist the taste of the bait; and the elephant, craving contact with its mate, perishes in the quicksand.

    {q: 'The adorning quality of this human existence is that one’s karma can be transformed. No matter how fragile and impermanent one’s life, one can transcend and purify one’s karma.

    {q: 'An effortless compassion can arise for all beings who have not realized their true nature. So limitless is it that if tears could express it, you would cry without end. Not only compassion, but tremendous skillful means can be born when you realize the nature of mind. Also you are naturally liberated from all suffering and fear, such as the fear of birth, death and the intermediate state. Then if you were to speak of the joy and bliss that arise from this realization, it is said by the buddhas that if you were to gather all the glory, enjoyment, pleasure and happiness of the world and put it all together, it would not approach one tiny fraction of the bliss that you experience upon realizing the nature of mind.', a: 'Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'When the teachings say we need to reduce our fascination with the things of this life, it does not mean that we should abandon them completely. It means avoiding the natural tendency to go from elation to depression in reaction to life\'s ups and downs, jumping for joy when you have some success, or wanting to jump out the window if you do not get what you want.

Are you enjoying the fulfillment of inner freedom?<br/>After years of practice, we should gain a sense of inner peace and become less vulnerable to outer circumstance. Masters such as Patrul Rinpoche experienced great joy and profound happiness as a result of their Dharma practice. Inner freedom, relaxed and open happiness, and joy will arise when disturbing emotions and mental confusions disappear.

This automatically diminishes our craving to repeat similar experiences. We find ourselves no longer so driven to crank up our life in an attempt to have more and to accomplish more, since we\'ve already tasted that fruit, with all the accompanying emotions. We can begin to relax a little, being content with all that we\'ve experienced already in our life. This process of awareness and appreciation naturally generates a fuller sense of renunciation. It is not something that needs to be very deliberate, but rather it occurs more and more as our life unfolds, unless we try holding onto things too tightly. This natural renunciation is happening all the time. If we can just allow that process, and foster an attitude of "practice mind" to go with it, then there will be an increasing amount of renunciation occurring every year.', a: 'Dzigar Kongtrül Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'Because we don\'t recognize our essential nature — we don’t realize that although appearances arise unceasingly, nothing is really there — we invest with solidity and reality the seeming truth of self, other, and actions between self and others.

This entire process needs to be purified.', a: 'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Every strong attachment generates an equally powerful fear that we’ll either fail to get what we want or lose whatever we’ve already gained.

    {q: 'It is often seen that human beings can endure problems quite well, but cannot endure success. When we are successful and have everything we desire, it can easily go to our heads. There is a great danger of losing our common sense and becoming careless and arrogant. As it is said, “Nothing corrupts a person more than power.” Very powerful people sometimes become so proud that they no longer care about their actions or about the effect they have on others. Losing any sense of right and wrong, they create severe problems for themselves and everyone else. Even if we have all the success we could dream of—fame, wealth, and so on—we must understand that these things have no real substance. Attachment does not come from having things, but from the way our mind reacts to them. It is fine to participate in good circumstances, provided we can see that they have no real essence. They may come and they may go. When seeing this, we will not become so attached. Even if we lose our wealth we will not be badly affected, and while it is there we will enjoy it without being senseless and arrogant.', a: 'Ringu Tulku'},

    {q: 'When the mind is positive, body and speech, the servants of the mind, will of course be positive also. But how are we to make the mind positive? At the moment, we cling to the notion that our minds are real entities. When someone helps us, we think, ‘That person has been so good to me. I must be kind to him in return and make him my friend for lives and lives to come.’ This only goes to show that we do not know about the empty nature of the mind. As for our enemies, we think of how to harm them as much as possible… We think like that simply because we think our anger is a true and permanent reality – while in fact it is nothing at all.

But happiness has nothing to do with it. Happiness has nothing to do with pleasure one after the other. Happiness is an inner state of security, knowing that we will be able to deal with whatever happens.

We delight in practicing virtuous activities like a merchant traveling to an island of gold.

    {q: 'Why do we need dualistic practices, such as generating merit, to reach a state that transcends duality? Because we have to start from where we are. Our mind’s true nature is covered by karmic turbulence caused by our grasping at self and our negative mental habits. “Grasping at a self” refers to the way we grasp at mental objects as truly existing, perceiving them dualistically as subject and object. The aspect of our mind that perceives this way is conceptual mind. Conceptual mind and the true nature of mind are like the surface and depths of the ocean: The surface is choppy with wind-tossed waves; beneath it is still and peaceful.<br/><br/>Most of us can’t glimpse into the depths, our true nature, because our conceptual mind is constantly churning out turbulence. Grasping at self tricks us, like a nightmare, into believing that we are separate from the world and each other. This triggers negative emotions, from craving and anxiety to jealousy and aggression, which spill out into unhealthy words and actions.<br/><br/>Every dualistic perception, every negative thought, feeling, word, and deed, leaves a negative karmic imprint in our conceptual mind that walls us off from our true nature. On the other hand, positive mentalities leave positive karmic imprints that open our mind, loosen grasping at self, and thin out the barriers to our true nature.<br/><br/>As long as we have dualistic concepts and emotions, the world is solid to us. Our suffering is all too real. Circumstances matter. If our surroundings are chaotic, it will be hard to find tranquillity. If we experience peace and joy, however, we will be inspired to generate even more peace and joy. Then whatever we say and do will be the words and deeds of joy and peace. We progressively loosen our grasping at self, and eventually we glimpse the luminous nature of our mind. If we perfect this realization, we uproot grasping at self and become fully awakened.', a: 'Tulku Thondup'},

This fear-driven approach to life is like covering your couch in plastic so it won\'t get worn. It robs you of the ability to enjoy and appreciate your life. It takes courage to accept life fully, to say yes to our life, yes to our karma, yes to our mind, emotions and whatever else unfolds. This is the beginning of courage. Courage is the fundamental openness to face even the hardest truths. It makes room for all the pain, joy, irony, and mystery that life provides.', a: 'Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'The attitude and intention for embracing any Dharma needs to be a real and deep-rooted one, not an emotional one. Many people with fleeting emotions think that they have the required mindset, but they haven\'t, and they also have immediate expectations for some great results. But if you practise Dharma with such an idea of worldly reward or achievement, then that is not the real practice of Dharma. Practicing Dharma needs a long-term determination to practice continuously in this and all the coming lifetimes. So I think that has not matured in the minds of many new Western Buddhist practitioners, and due to this short-term expectation and day-by-day evaluation, which hardly shows swift progress, one day you will find yourself frustrated and give up the practice. So before entering into the practise, you must have a deep understanding and study, and then examine yourself, whether you are able to endure it on a sustainable basis and only then should you get into the practice of Dharma. Otherwise it will become a kind of child\'s play and that may be no good for anyone.', a: 'Samdhong Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'The true bodhisattva spirit grows out of this personal sense of freedom. You discover that you don\'t feel so needy anymore.

With this sense of security and freedom, you begin to direct your attention to the needs of others. The compassion expands. This is my point about inner simplicity as the basis for living fearlessly in a complex world.<br/><br/>This principle of fearless simplicity involves training in the two accumulations as a unity and experiencing the fruition of such training. We have found a true, effective remedy for ego-clinging, negative emotions, the twofold ignorance, and adversity. We have persevered in the two accumulations, and we have grown confident in liberation.

If thinking about them continues to be painful, it is a sign that you have not let go of feeling they have wronged you. Try not to focus on it.

If you are filled with worry, with fear, that is not actually compassion. We become exhausted by our ideas, but genuine compassion is bigger than our ideas, it\'s stronger, it has no exhaustion.

It is the traditional teaching and the Mahayana tells us that this is the purpose and goal. Fine. But we have to bite what we can chew. If we keep on biting for enlightenment we may get nowhere. I remember when I was a kid, I got this big rock sugar and tried to bite the whole thing and got nothing, except a little bit. So bite only what you can chew. Then it has nice taste, is sweet, juicy and it helps and it is great. The spiritual practice is also like that. Yes, the ultimate goal is to become Buddha. That will be fine. Leave it there. Temporarily you have to make yourself better - today. Really, it is important today. Today is very important. You have to make yourself better today and tomorrow. So every day we have to look in that way. That is our goal - to make one day better. Take it day by day and sometimes hour by hour. I keep on talking that we have to do something to make ourselves better. It is almost like talking about change without saying what to change.<br/><br/>What is there to do? Three things, remember: Morality, concentration and wisdom. Combine them together in everyday life and it doesn\'t have to be the perfect wisdom of emptiness. Wisdom, whatever you can manage, put that wisdom in your daily life. Keep your morality, whatever you can manage, in your life. Focus whatever you can focus and make it the best. That\'s how we spend our life. Make your life better day by day. When you do that you will see different results within you. That\'s what you need. That\'s something we can chew, so what\'s what we can bite.', a: 'Gelek Rinpoche'},

    {q: 'The great Longchenpa said, when the moon rises and when there is a clear lake, even though you may not wish it, the moon is reflected in the lake. Likewise, as long as sentient beings have merit, the image of the Buddha and his teachings and his blessing are reflected, even though you don\'t search for them. But if the lake is murky and defiled and not clear, even though the moon is shining in the clear sky, the reflection of the moon doesn\'t exist.<br/><br/>Likewise, even though the compassion of the Buddha is infinite and ever-present, if there is no merit among sentient beings for the Buddhas to reflect, then the chance of communication with the Buddha probably does not exist.

    {q: 'People with a misconception about meditation believe that all thoughts should cease. We cannot, in fact, establish ourselves in a state devoid of thoughts.

    {q: 'Such is the strength of delusion and habitual tendencies that practicing Dharma might initially seem very hard; but these difficulties will gradually subside. Once you have understood the essential point of the teachings, you will experience no hardship or difficulty with the practice. Your efforts will bring you joy. It is like developing any skill - as you master the important points, it becomes progressively easier, you gain increasing confidence, and your capacity and endeavor keep on growing.<br/><br/>Whatever meditation or reflection you have done, it will never be wasted. The benefit it brings will be present in your mindstream at the time of your death, and will help you be reborn in a place where the Dharma flourishes, near an authentic spiritual teacher. Life after life, you will evolve from a mediocre into an average practitioner into an excellent one. The essence of learning is reflection, and the essence of reflection is meditation. As you go deeper into the meaning of the teachings, the wondrous qualities of the Dharma will become ever clearer, like the sun appearing ever brighter the higher you fly.<br/><br/>The sign that you have fully assimilated your learning of the Dharma is that you become peaceful by nature. The sign that you have assimilated your meditation is that you are free of obscuring emotions. As learning leads to reflection and reflection transforms into meditation, your eagerness for the deluded activities of this life will relax, and you will yearn for the Dharma instead.<br/><br/>Anything you do that is in accord with the Dharma, however small or trivial it may seem, will be beneficial.

A good mind is like a rich ground of gleaming gold, lighting up the whole sky with its golden radiance. But if body, speech, and mind are not tamed, there is very little chance that you will achieve any realization whatsoever. Be aware of your thoughts, words, and actions at all times.

On the other hand, if you are practicing, there is no need to exhibit that you are Buddhist. As a matter of fact, if it helps you to get invited to some social functions, it is totally fine to hide that you are a Buddhist. But keep in mind that as a Buddhist, you have a mission to refrain as much as possible from harming others, and to help others as much as possible.

    {q: 'People who lack faith are deprived of the good fortune of being able to practice the Dharma, and their not having faith is therefore an immeasurable defect.

Without faith, it is as impossible to nurture good qualities in one’s being as it is for someone with no hands to pick up anything even if he were to find himself on an island of gold. Without faith, it is impossible for the shoot of bodhichitta to grow, for nothing can ever sprout from a burned seed. Without faith, one is like a blind person who finds himself in a temple: it is impossible to see the light of the Dharma. Without faith, however clever one is, one is trapped in the deep pit of cyclic existence: everything one does becomes an action that leads to cyclic existence, and it is impossible to ever attain the freedom of enlightenment.

    {q: 'Done right, discipline is taken on joyfully and with a clear understanding of why engaging in it is good. For example, many people nowadays have given up eating meat. Why would we do that? We should not become vegetarian just because someone says we should, or because the Buddha taught that we should not eat meat, or because it is the custom where we live, or because giving up meat would give us a good reputation. If we give up eating meat for these reasons, it might be better not to do it at all, because our decision is not sincerely motivated.<br/>In the beginning, we have a certain feeling about not eating meat. Then we can ask ourselves questions, such as what are the real benefits? After careful consideration, we become certain that this is the right thing to do. Our answer has to come from within, inspired by real conviction, so that when we do give up eating meat, it does not become a hardship or a struggle but something we do with joy and intelligence. It is the same with any discipline in the Vinaya, the Mahayana, or the Vajrayana. Whatever we give up or whatever we do, we should first feel a connection to the practice and then be very clear why we are doing this and not something else. When we act this way, our discipline becomes very inspiring.', a: '17th Karmapa'},
    {q: 'What is the difference between the real state of rigpa and the imitation? Check whether or not there is any clinging, any sense of keeping hold of something. With conceptual rigpa you notice a sense of trying to keep a state, trying to maintain a state, trying to nurture a state. There is a sense of hope or fear and also a sense of being occupied. Understand? The keeping means there’s a sense of protecting, of not wanting to lose it, in the back of the mind. This is not bad, it’s good, and for some people there’s no way around training like that in the beginning. Through training in this way, that conceptual aspect becomes increasingly refined and clarified.<br/><br/>So you practice more, more, more. Now you have more of a sense of openness, but still you’re holding this openness. All right, then, let the openness go. Let’s say that after two months you let it go. But still you’re staying within the openness — so then you practice letting go of the staying. And somehow there is still a remnant of wanting to achieve it again.

You can’t give up the water because there is none; it is only a mirage. Moreover, you don’t have to give up a mirage, because what is the point of giving up a mirage? One need simply know that it is a mirage. Such understanding is a big renunciation. The moment you know that it is a mirage, most likely you will not even go there because you know it is fake.

    {q: 'During meditation one\'s mind, being evenly settled in its own natural way, is like still water, unruffled by ripple or breeze, and as any thought or change arises in that stillness it forms, like a wave in the ocean, and disappears back into it again. Left naturally, it dissolves; naturally. Whatever turbulence of mind erupts- if you let it be, it will of its own course play itself out, liberate itself; and thus the view arrived at through meditation is that whatever appears is none other than the self display or projection of the mind. <br/><br/>In continuing the perspective of this view into the activities and events of everyday life, the grasp of dualistic perception of the world as solid, fixed and tangible reality (which is <br/>the root cause of our problems) begins to loosen and dissolves. Mind is like the wind. It comes and goes; and through increasing certainty in this view one begins to appreciate <br/>the humor of the situation. Things start to feel somewhat unreal, and the attachment and importance which one signifies to events begin to seem ridiculous, or at any rate <br/>lighthearted. <br/><br/>Thus one develops the ability to dissolve perception by continuing the flowing awareness of meditation into everyday life, seeing everything as the self-manifest play of the mind. <br/>And immediately after sitting meditation, the continuation of this awareness is helped by doing what you have to do calmly and quietly, with simplicity and without agitation. <br/><br/>So in a sense everything is like a dream, illusory, but even so humorously one goes on doing things. If you are walking, for instance, without unnecessary solemnity or self-consciousness, but lightheartedly walk towards the open space of suchness, truth. When you eat, be the stronghold of truth, what is. As you eat, feed the negativities and illusions into the belly of emptiness, dissolving them into space; and when you are pissing consider all your obscurations and blockages are being cleansed and washed away. <br/><br/>So far I have told you the essence of the practice in a nutshell, but you must realize that as long as we continue to see the world in a dualistic way, until we are really free of attachment and negativity, and have dissolved all our outer perceptions into the purity of the empty nature of mind, we are still stuck in the relative world of good and bad, positive and negative actions, and we must respect these laws and be mindful and responsible for our actions.', a: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},

Otherwise, it might be something that is a problem indeed, but there is more solution than problem itself, and I can guarantee you one thing (this is my little experience through the blessing of the dharma): the solution for the problem is in the problem. I guarantee you. It is always there. It is just like a question: when somebody asks a question, if that person breaks down that question for themselves then that is the answer. The answer is in the question, you know? The solution is in the problem, but it is very hard to see – especially if it is your problem. You can feel your problem from the tip of your hair into the middle of your bones, and therefore you cannot have the perspective easily, but if you can relax then you are able to see more clearly. That’s the principle of meditation. When you meditate with sacred methods of meditation then, through the blessing of the lineage and so forth, that potential for seeing things clearly – the primordial wisdom – awakens. Even temporarily, it makes all the difference on earth, all the difference that you can think of. It will make a big difference, an enormous difference.', a: 'Tai Situ Rinpoche'},

To see if you’ll attain liberation in the future or not, check whether your conduct is good or bad. To see if you’ve given rise to loving kindness and compassion or not, check how you take care of those in need. To see if you’ve tamed the demon of anger or not, check how much hatred you feel towards your enemies. To see if you’ve dispelled the obscuring demon of ignorance or not, check how much you cling in hope and fear.

    {q: 'Please understand that all sentient beings, all our parents, want nothing but happiness. Unfortunately, through their negative actions they only create the causes for further pain and suffering. Take this to heart and consider all our parents, wandering blindly and endlessly through painful samsaric states.

This compassionate attitude is indispensable as a preparation for practice.', a: 'Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Before wanting to take care of others, one must first be able to love oneself. Loving oneself is not based on a sense of personal debt for which one is accountable to oneself but simply on the fact that by nature we all strive to be happy and not suffer. It is only after accepting this benevolence toward oneself that it is possible to extend it to all others.', a: '14th Dalai Lama'},

    {q: 'Of sustained calm and profound insight, it is profound insight that is most important; but profound insight cannot arise without a preliminary calming of the mind. What is crucial here is to calm all the wild thoughts that constantly agitate, unsettle, and condition the mind, for such thoughts give rise to negative emotions which, in turn, you express as the words and actions that comprise the causes of suffering.<br/><br/>Calming the mind is like closing the glass of a lantern around the flame, so that it can shine brightly and steadily, protected from the wind.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

Therefore, Bodhicitta should be the main point in the practice of all practitioners, those who thirst for the most supreme happiness.

It is wonderful that human beings can do such a fantastic exchange and that they are willing to invite such undesirable situations into their world. It is wonderful that they are willing to let go of even their smallest corners of secrecy and privacy, so that their holding on to anything is gone completely. That is very brave. We could certainly say that this is the world of the warrior, from the Bodhisattva\'s point of view.', a: 'Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche'},

You might find it hard to imagine that this potential for compassion exists in everyone when violence, massacres, genocide, and “ethnic cleansing” are happening throughout the world. You might even begin to believe that human nature is basically evil. But this is not the case. If, through introspection and meditation, you look deeply at the mind itself, you will apprehend the most fundamental aspect of consciousness, pure awareness. This nature of mind remains unspoiled even though obscuring emotions might temporarily cover it.', a: 'Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'The ancient Bodhisattvas are always encouraging us,<br/>not because they have done great things, but because they are not afraid of anything.<br/>They are not afraid of poverty, they are not afraid of death, and they are not afraid of failure.<br/>They found joy in failure, in poverty, and in doing some small things. <br/>That is the Bodhisattva-mind.', a: 'Shunryu Suzuki'},

On the other hand, if they don’t arise, don’t be nervously wondering whether or not they will. Just rest in their absence.<br/>If big, well-defined thoughts suddenly appear during your meditation, it is easy to recognize them. But when slight, subtle movements occur, it is hard to realize that they are there until much later. This is what we call namtok wogyu, the undercurrent of mental wandering. This is the thief of your meditation, so it is important for you to keep a close watch.

    {q: 'If we shake our hand in front of our face we will not see its shape, as there is no stability or clarity. But the less it shakes, the more of it we can see. Likewise, it is impossible for our mind to experience great results on the buddhist path if it has continuous agitation and dullness. The less agitation and dullness, the greater the stability and clarity, therefore the more power the mind has during any meditation on the path, whether sutra, tantra, or dzogchen.', a: 'Chamtrul Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'By sincerely training in the meditation practice of exchanging suffering for happiness, you will eventually become capable of actually taking on others\' illnesses and curing them and giving them your happiness in reality.

    {q: 'Desire and attachment will not change overnight, but desire becomes less ordinary as we redirect our worldly yearning toward the aspiration to become enlightened for the benefit of others. At the same time, we don’t abandon the ordinary objects of our desires – relationships, wealth, fame – but our attachment to them lessens as we contemplate their impermanence. Not rejecting them, rejoicing in our fortune when they arise, yet recognizing that they won’t last, we begin to build qualities of spiritual maturity. As our attachment slowly decreases, harmful actions that would normally result from attachment are reduced. We create less negative karma, more fortunate karma, and the mind’s positive qualities gradually increase.', a: 'Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'We need to seriously investigate whether people who have fame, power, and wealth are happy and whether those who have nothing are always unhappy. When we look into this, we see that happiness is not based on objects but on one’s mental state. For that reason, those who are truly happy are the ones who appreciate what they have. Whenever we are content, in that moment, we are fulfilled. The teachings of the Buddha are common sense.', a: 'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'It should be clearly understood that anyone who has realized the nature of emptiness experiences the spontaneous arising of bodhicitta. There is no realization of emptiness that doesn\'t inherently contain bodhicitta. Just like fire is hot, the nature of emptiness is compassion.', a: 'Yangthang Rinpoche'},

It is very important to look at this closely and come to really understand this.<br/><br/>The Buddha said that just like the elephant has the biggest footprint among all animals, the thought of impermanence is the best among all our thoughts. To reflect on impermanence means to look closely at our nature and our environment without ignoring or trying to hide anything. The ego is very tricky—it doesn’t like to deal with the true face of reality. It likes to hide and ignore things because of its grasping and clinging. Looking closely at reality, and taking this opportunity to make our selves and others better is our goal as sangha members and practitioners.', a: 'Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches'},
    {q: 'Ignorance literally means “not knowing.” What is it that is supposed to be known? We need to be able to know our basic nature - the original unconditioned state that lies at the very heart of every moment of consciousness. Whatever that nature is, it is not derived from religion or philosophy. It has to do with simply with what is. Knowing the natural state is not a frame of mind. It’s not a mode of perceiving. As a matter of fact, our basic nature is totally free of concepts.', a: 'Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'The secret, all the time, is what is closest to you without you even knowing. That is why it is called a secret. Many people think Dharma is something far away, something distant. Oh no my friends! Dharma is so close, closer than your own heartbeat, but you never hear it, or you never feel. So it is like a secret with yourself. Within you, is the secret you didn’t realize. <br/><br/>In order to practice Dharma genuinely, you need to make mistakes. When you make mistakes you learn more, you develop more. Without making mistakes, and then seeing the results, without putting in the effort, you cannot improve in Dharma practice. Likewise dharma practice is something you must apply practically in your life. If it\'s not practical, if you can\'t apply it, it\'s not Dharma.<br/><br/>When you see your mistakes, your faults, please start to think that this means you are actually improving. When you see your improving, you need to think what you are revealing is actually your innate nature. When you see the innate nature, you need to, without any grasping, you need to maintain genuinely, you need to let go of all the concepts that you ever have. That is the secret that is within our heart but nobody knows it, and nobody hears it.', a: 'Phakchok Rinpoche'},

Just let them be. This is much simpler and more effective than trying to avoid fear or get rid of fearful things, which won’t work in any case.

It is a matter of discovering what already exists within us. Like cleaning the surface of a stone inscription, the more you clean it, the more the original carving becomes apparent.

Constant vigilance is the mark of a sincere practitioner. You may know how to practice when everything is going well, but that is of little use if you succumb to the first emotion that hits you.<br/><br/>Good practitioners can be recognized by their response to difficult situations liable to provoke latent emotions. Those capable of reacting immediately with the correct antidote will have no problem overcoming obstacles.<br/><br/>In particular, if they know how to transcend the concepts of subject and object, all their thoughts will liberate themselves, like a snake wriggling out of the knots tied in its own body, without effort or help.

We can bind ourselves further in samsara or we can free ourselves from it right now. It is all up to us. We are the ones who have to keep looking at our thoughts, looking for the nature of our mind.

Therefore, in our application of the techniques of mindfulness, we must be aware of the fundamental tendency to cling, to survive. We come to this in the mindfulness of life, or survival. We encounter this tendency in the form of clinging to the meditative state. We experience the meditative state and it is momentarily tangible, but in that same moment it is also dissolving.

I do not think much of this. Although there are people of the highest caliber who attain enlightenment without study or reflection, are you of such caliber? Therefore, you cannot live in a cave or another completely isolated place when you first start to practice. Instead, you should be with a qualified Dharma teacher and earnestly receive the Buddhadharma; it is best if you are always engaged in study, reflection, and practice.

We spend decades of our lives wanting happiness, peace, and contentment—without sowing the causes for that aspiration. Why did we not plant the seeds of the fruition we aspire to? Buddhist logic says that if you plant a lemon seed and pray for a mango fruit, logically it won’t work. But this is what we do: we wish for happiness without planting the seeds of happiness.<br/><br/>In fact, we do the exact opposite. We plant the causes of carelessness, thoughtlessness, mindlessness, and a lack of awareness, conscientiousness, and consideration for others and their well being—all the time hoping for happiness and cessation of suffering.

For countless previous lifetimes we’ve been carrying on like this, perpetuating the cycle of suffering, living fulltime with the thought of the eight worldly dharmas.<br/><br/>Unless we can break this cycle we will continue like this, doing the same thing on and on endlessly, because we’re using entirely the wrong methods to deal with our immediate worldly problems. We’re forever creating the causes for much greater suffering for ourselves. Really, we are crazy; completely crazy.', a: 'Lama Zopa Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'One way to understand moods is that they are just the habit patterns of our mind continually playing themselves out in different scenarios. According to the view of Dharma, we don’t need to understand them or consider them so much as we need to replace them with new habits. This is where practice comes in. When we practice, we involve our body, emotions and mind in a new habit which is much more “real” in the sense that it is in line with the reality of enlightenment. This is the definition of purification.<br/>The problem with paying much attention at all to emotional states is that we must on some level believe that they are real if we are considering them at all. We reinforce our sense of egoic reality by examining and exploring them, much in the way Narcissus was enamored of his reflection. When we come to practice from that place, we create extra obstacles and encounter even greater resistance.', a: 'Adzom Rinpoche'},

We plug into this idea that somehow it’s something we have to force ourselves to do and at the end of it we will succeed or fail. And I think it’s very important to realize it’s nothing to do with that at all. That’s just the ego wanting to be a meditator.<br/><br/>The whole secret of meditation is to learn just how to be present in the moment and in a state of complete openness and relaxation. It’s not a matter of gaining, it’s a matter of losing, of dropping—letting go, letting go, letting go. I think it’s really very important, especially in this age where we’re all programmed to want to get something that it’s not a matter of what you get, it’s a matter of what you lose.', a: 'Jetsünma Tenzin Palmo'},
    {q: 'Recognizing the instability of causes and conditions leads us to understand our own power to transform obstacles and make the impossible possible. This is true in every area of life. If you don’t have a Ferrari, you very well may create the conditions to have one. As long as there is a Ferrari, there is the opportunity for you to own one. Likewise if you want to live longer, you can choose to stop smoking and exercise more. There is reasonable hope. Hopelessness — just like its opposite, blind hope — is the result of a belief in permanence.<br/><br/>You can transform not only your physical world but your emotional world, for example, turning agitation into peace of mind by letting go of ambition or turning low self-respect into confidence by acting out of kindness and philanthropy.

This is why guru devotion is necessary.<br/><br/>For example, you may be having a nightmare about monsters. But then suddenly, somebody throws a bucket of cold water over you and you wake up. The cold water doesn’t really make the monsters disappear, because there were no monsters in the first place. It was just a dream. But on the other hand, when you are having a nightmare, your sufferings are real, and the person who throws the bucket of water over you is indeed very kind and special. If you have a lot of merit you are able to meet such a person, a person who can throw the water. On the other hand, if you don’t have merit, you may never wake up from the nightmare.<br/><br/>The guru lineage originates with someone called Vajradhara or Samantabhadra. Our masters tell us that he is our own mind, the nature of our own mind. This means that when we trace back through the lineage, we actually end up with our own minds, the essence of ourselves.

Until very recently, Buddhist masters brought up in Tibet would have looked on salad, green vegetables and grass as animal fodder and would never willingly eat it themselves. Now that Tibetans have become familiar with food outside Tibet, their attitudes have changed, and it is precisely this kind of shift in our perception that we work with in “creation meditation.” <br/><br/>Another example can be found on the World Wide Web. Most erotic pictures are usually quite small—certainly nowhere near life-sized. Logically, it is hard to believe that such tiny images could cause living, breathing human beings to become aroused, but they do. <br/><br/>Our habits are so entrenched that having programmed ourselves to respond to a specific kind of image, it will consistently have the power to turn us on or make us angry, sad or even depressed, even when we see it on a tiny 14 x 8 cm YouTube screen.

In a fog, you do not know you are getting wet, but as you keep walking you get wet little by little. If your mind has ideas of progress, you may say, “Oh, this pace is terrible!” But actually it is not. When you get wet in a fog it is very difficult to dry yourself.

The concept of karma enters when we add ethical intention to cause and effect: virtuous activity leads to positive experience, and non-virtuous activity leads to negative experience. When we extend our investigations of cause and effect to intention, motivation, impulses, incentives, and so forth, then we can recognize that this same interplay between cause and effect conditions our mind and shapes our experience. If we want to be happy, we must figure out what causes and conditions lead to well-being. Similarly, if we don\'t have a clear understanding of the conditions that cause suffering, how could we possibly expect to free ourselves from it?', a: 'Mingyur Rinpoche'},

Yet we tend to think that the only relationships we have with other beings are the tiny number, comparatively, that we have at present. Wherever we live, we like a few people, dislike a few others, and ignore all the rest. Based on this prejudiced and very limited perception of others, we keep giving rise to attachment and aggression. Thus we accumulate karma, the driving force of samsara.<br/>If we could see the endless sequence of lives we have led in the past, we would know that there is not a single being on earth who has not been our father or our mother, not only once but many times over. To return the love and great kindness they have shown us, we must cultivate love and compassion for all of them, as the great enlightened ones do. Above all, we should aspire from the depths of our heart to be able to bring them to perfect enlightenment, without leaving a single one of them behind. The merit arising from such an aspiration is in proportion to the number of beings, so the wish to liberate innumerable beings can engender an immeasurable amount of merit.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

At this time of day we would normally be relaxing and enjoying ourselves, but we gave up our time to come here and talk about Dharma—we gave some of our time, and this is GIVING. Since a mind without pride and jealousy is a pure mind and the very essence of all ethics, if we listen to the teachings without pride or jealousy, we are practicing ETHICS. While listening to the teachings we get thirsty, we feel hungry, and our knees become sore, but we willingly put up with all these difficulties. In this way we practice PATIENCE. Patience is not simply passive; it demands energy. Listening to the teachings in the constant awareness that we are listening to them is the practice of energy, or DILIGENCE, and concentrating on the importance of the teachings is the practice of CONCENTRATION. Listening attentively to the teachings, thinking about them, and asking questions is the practice of PENETRATING INTUITION in listening to the teachings.

Actually we live day by day in the mirage of what we want to see ourselves. Have you noticed that? We know how we are inside. We don’t want people to see that, our teachers to see that. We create this fake mirage of ourselves, to show people this is who i am. What are we. If you like to live a fake life, it’s up to you.

This is because that kind of experience will give you the ability to prevent yourself from being overwhelmed by circumstances, good or bad. You will not fall into extreme states of mind: you will not get over-excited or depressed. Your attitude toward circumstances and events will be as if you were someone observing the mind, without being drawn away by circumstances.<br/><br/>For example, when you see a reflection of a form in a mirror, the reflection appears within the mirror but it is not projected from within. In the same way, when you confront the situations of life, or deal with others, your attitude too will be mirror-like. Also, when a reflection appears in the mirror, the mirror does not have to go after the object that is reflected: it simply reflects, spontaneously, on the surface. The same with you: since there is no attachment or agitation at having these \'reflections\' in your mind, you will feel tremendous ease and relief. You are not preoccupied by what arises in the mind, nor does it cause you any distress. You are free from conceptuality or any form of objectifying. And so it really does help you, in allowing you to be free from being caught up in the play of emotions like hatred, attachment, and the like.', a: '14th Dalai Lama'},

Therefore, the results they get are opposite to what they want. That is quite simple logic, don’t you think? We are the embodiment of liberation and freedom and that is ultimate happiness and joy. If we do something that is contrary to that, then we will end up suffering. It is not somebody’s punishment for us.

    {q: 'Each person\'s life is like a mandala- a vast, limitless circle. We stand in the center of our own circle, and everything we see, hear and think forms the mandala of our life. We enter a room, and the room is our mandala. We get on the subway, and the subway car is our mandala, down to the teenager checking messages on her iPhone and the homeless man slumped in the corner. We go for a hike in the mountains, and everything as far as we can see is our mandala: the clouds, the trees, the snow on the peeks, even the rattlesnake coiled in the corner. We\'re lying in a hospital bed, and the hospital is our mandala. We don\'t set it up, we don\'t get to choose what or who shows up in it. It is, As Chogyam Trungpa said, "the mandala that is never arranged but is always complete." And we embrace it just as it is.<br/>Everything that shows up in your mandala is a vehicle for your awakening. From this point of view, awakening is right at your fingertips continually. There\'s not a drop of rain or a pile of dog poop that appears in your life that isn\'t the manifestation of enlightened energy, that isn\'t a doorway to sacred world. But it\'s up to you whether your life is a mandala of neurosis or a mandala of sanity.', a: 'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q: 'We hear a lot about the pain of samsara, and we also hear about liberation. But we don\'t hear much about how painful it is to go from being completely stuck to becoming unstuck. The process of becoming unstuck requires tremendous bravery, because basically we are completely changing our way of perceiving reality, like changing our DNA. We are undoing a pattern that is not just our pattern. It\'s the human pattern: we project onto the world a zillion possibilities of attaining resolution. We can have whiter teeth, a weed-free lawn, a strife-free life, a world without embarrassment. We can live happily every after. This pattern keeps us dissatisfied and causes us a lot of suffering.', a: 'Pema Chödrön'},
    {q: 'When we start to meditate or to work with any kind of spiritual discipline,we often think that somehow we\'re going to improve, which is a subtle aggression against who we really are. It\'s a bit like saying, "If I jog I\'ll be a much better person." "If I had a nicer house I\'d be a better person." "If I could meditate and calm down I\'d be a better person." Or the scenario may be that we find fault with others. We might say, "If it weren\'t for my husband I\'d have a perfect marriage." "If it weren\'t for the fact that my boss and I can\'t get on, my job would be just great." And, "If it weren\'t for my mind, my meditation would be just excellent."<br/>But loving-kindness (maitri) towards ourselves doesn\'t mean getting rid of anything. Maitri means that we can still be crazy, we can still be angry. We can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthiness. Meditation practice isn\'t about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better. It\'s about befriending who we are already.', a: 'Pema Chödrön'},

Similarly, the Yogi-because of recognizing all appearances to be his own mind-is free or fear or timidity in the face of any adversity or difficulty. <br/><br/>Second, the Yogi of medium abilities-just like a crazy person who is neither shy nor cling to concepts of clean and unclean-is someone for whom clinging naturally dissolves, having neither attachment to the concepts of good and bad nor judgmental preferences.<br/><br/>Third,, just like a child can remain unattached, without craving, and be very natural-it is taught that the Yogi as well should be free of clinging and attachment.<br/><br/>These are the true ways for a Yogi to practice.', a: 'Shri Singha'},

It might be difficult at first, but you will never attain enlightenment as long as you continue to feel ill-will towards your enemies. Those who are now your enemies were in former lives your parents, and there is nothing fixed about the status of an enemy or friend. To feel hostility towards enemies and affection towards your friends is nothing but a deluded form of perception. If you train your mind to recognize everything as insubstantial like a dream, hostility towards enemies will lose its meaning entirely. This is crucially important, because ordinarily our lives are driven by the yearning to acquire food and clothing, possessions, partners, status and acclaim. We put a great deal of thought into devising the cleverest, most efficient ways to obtain them, and we think, “So-and-so has this much money, my friends have this much, so I need more.” Or: “In the past, I stayed in this kind of house, in this part of town, but now I shall move to a better place.” We must put a stop to all such thinking.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},

It often comes as a shock that the teachings and practices laid out by the Buddha twenty-five hundred years ago do not in any way involve conquering problems or getting rid of the sense of loneliness, discomfort, or fear that haunts our daily lives.

Through the blessings and kindness of the teachers, it is now possible for us to receive, study and practise the doctrine. But if we are preoccupied only with the worldly activities of this life: business, farming, prevailing over enemies, helping friends, hoping for an important position and so on-and we die before we have made time for spiritual practice, it would be just like coming home empty-handed from the Isle of jewels. What an incredible waste! Therefore we should think to ourselves, \'I am not going to miss my chance. While I have this precious opportunity, I will practise the Dharma.\' Of course, the best thing would be to practice for the whole of our lives; but at least we should take refuge properly, for this is the essence of the Buddhadharma and closes the door to the lower realms.

We should check whether the practice of bodhichitta goes well or not, whether it is getting better, or it is getting worse. Don’t lose mindfulness. If you lose mindfulness, it would be like a house that has a hole, which allows thieves to break in. We should always keep our mindfulness and don’t let the enemies of delusions find their way in. If we lose mindfulness, enemies of delusions will break in through the hole. Then the bodhichitta will be stolen from your house. In order to prevent delusions, such as desire, hatred and ignorance, and pride, the first method to apply is mindfulness. If we can always apply mindfulness, enemies of ignorance will not come in.

Or we are so tired of being busy that we want to do something mindless and easy, like watching a television show, or taking a nap. Then, we go back to being busy. There is a way to feel refreshed and alert without being busy. All we need is a gentle reminder—a location, an image, or a sound—to help us return home to ourselves and pay attention to what is there inside us and around us.

    {q: 'In general, people tend to minimize the importance of the ordinary sangha: Buddha is a big deal, Dharma is a big deal, and Sangha is something to put up with. Yet it’s within the ordinary sangha, monastic or lay, that the roughest edges of our arrogance and pride can be smoothed down a little. Americans — with their car obsessions — have a good expression for this: “Where the rubber meets the road.” Let’s say there’s a shiny new car on the floor. It appears to be perfect. But we still need to take it for a test–drive. The car that never leaves the shop is like a practitioner reciting nice words about compassion and selflessness, but removed from the opportunity to test–drive their intentions and aspirations. How do the bodhisattva ideals hold up when we actually interact with others?<br/><br/>Problems within the sangha inevitably arise because we’re talking about unenlightened people trying to get along with each other.

Do not allow your mind to become distracted and just follow its inclinations.<br/><br/>If you become aware that you have succeeded to some extent in blending your mind with the Dharma, dedicate the merit to all beings, and aspire to do so more and more.

In their perception of pure sight, sound and awareness there is no attachment to friends, or aversion to enemies. Awareness itself being free from concepts of good and bad, proper and improper, they perceive everything as great equanimity. They do not accept or reject friends or foes. They perceive not the tiniest speck of impurity. As is said, "Arriving at a golden island, one cannot find ordinary earth or stones even if one searches for them."

Often, at the bottom of all this, there is an attitude of giving up and running away from one\'s own problems, with the illusion that one will be able to find something that will miraculously help one to transcend all that.

After crossing the threshold of the Secret Mantra, however, if we ruin our samaya by displeasing the Lama, causing havoc among our fellow Dharma practitioners and so on, the only possible destiny for us is the vajra hell. The saying goes that practitioners of Secret Mantra either attain buddhahood or go to hell. There is no third alternative. It’s like a snake inside a cane: it must go either up or down. There’s no way out halfway! Think carefully about the benefits and hazards of samaya, and observe it purely and perfectly. To do this, it is crucial to keep a close watch on your mind, a practice in which all the essential points of the teachings are condensed. It is vital to examine and watch your mind.

What is important, therefore, is that even if we live in a busy city, we make time for the Dharma, which means to make time for ourselves.

    {q: 'If you are truly generous, you will be free of all difficulties and will possess whatever wealth you need to carry out altruistic deeds until you gain enlightenment.<br/><br/>The Tibetan king Trisong Detsen is a good example of a bodhisattva who became a great ruler. He used his tremendous wealth to invite Guru Rinpoche, the great abbot Shantarakshita, the great pandita Vimalamitra, and a hundred and eight other Indian panditas to Tibet. <br/><br/>It was because of his patronage that the teachings of both sutra and tantra were given in Tibet, and that the first Tibetan translators were trained. His boundless generosity made the Dharma flourish, and there was immense happiness in the Land of Snows. Later, during the reign of other kings, the treasure rooms were locked and put under heavy guard, and both the Dharma and the prosperity of the Tibetan people declined.<br/><br/>People who are generous may not be trying to get rich, but the natural result of their merit will bring them ever-increasing wealth in their future lives. People tied up in their own miserliness, in contrast, will find themselves reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts, where not even the words food and drink are heard.<br/><br/>Never hope for anything in return for an act of generosity, and do not expect as a result that in your next life you will be treated well or be happy and prosperous. Generosity is complete in itself; there is no need for any other reward than having made others happy. If you give something motivated by self-interest, the joy you might have felt will be spoilt, and further unhappiness is certain to follow. <br/><br/>But giving out of sheer devotion, love, or compassion will bring you a feeling of great joy, and your gift will create yet more happiness. The motivation behind the act of giving makes all the difference.<br/><br/>Recognising all possessions to be like dreams or magical illusions, give them away as offerings or as charity without holding back. Through generosity, you will perfect your accumulation of merit, which leads in the end to the attainment of the major and minor marks of a buddha. Make sure that your generosity is always permeated with the enlightened attitude of bodhicitta, which is what makes it truly meaningful by turning it into an unerring cause for buddhahood.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'If we see others in trouble, although we cannot immediately take their suffering upon ourselves, we should make the wish to be able to relieve them from their misfortunes. Prayers like this will bear fruit eventually. Again, if others have very strong afflictive emotions, we should think, \'May all their emotions be concentrated in me.\' With fervent conviction, we should persist in thinking like this until we have some sign or feeling that we have been able to take upon ourselves the suffering and emotions of others. This might take the form of an increase in our own emotions or of the actual experience of the suffering and pain of others.<br/>This is how to bring hardships onto the path in order to free ourselves from hopes and fears - hopes, for instance, that we will not get ill, or fears that we might do so. They will thus be pacified in the equal taste of happiness and suffering. Eventually, through the power of bodhicitta, we will reach the point where we are free even from the hope of accomplishing bodhicitta and the fear of not doing so. Therefore we should have love for our enemies and try as much as possible to avoid getting angry with them, or harbouring any negative thoughts towards them. We should also try as much as possible to overcome our biased attachment to family and relatives. If you bind a crooked tree to a large wooden stake, it will eventually grow straight. Up to now, our minds have always been crooked, thinking how we might trick and mislead people, but this [bodichitta] practice, as Geshe Langri Tangpa said, will make our minds straight and true.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'If you cling to people too much and try to possess them, you will deprive them of their freedom. In this way attachment develops into resentment and jealousy. When your love has become tainted by jealousy, the result is misery. <br/>Your partner will eventually not even want to stay with you anymore. It is important to sustain pure love towards your friends. <br/>What is pure love?<br/>It is to wish for your friends to be happy. If you wish for the happiness of the other, the relationship will be stable because then there is no jealousy or resentment.', a: 'Garchen Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Look into the awakened mind of your own awareness! It has neither form nor color, neither center nor edge. At first, it has no origin but is empty. Next, it has no dwelling place but is empty. At the end, it has no destination but is empty. This emptiness is not made of anything and is clear and cognizant. When you see this and recognize it, you know your natural face. You understand the nature of things. You have then seen the nature of mind, resolved the basic state of reality and cut through doubts about topics of knowledge.', a: 'Padmasambhava'},
    {q: 'When, because of external or internal circumstances, there comes some sort of change, we need to be able to go along with that change. Then we can be more comfortable, relaxed and spacious.', a: '17th Karmapa'},
    {q: 'Even if someone says all sorts of derogatory things about me<br/>And proclaims them throughout the universe,<br/>In return, out of loving-kindness,<br/>To extol that person\'s qualities is the practice of a bodhisattva.<br/><br/>If someone defames and disgraces you, that is simply the result of having criticized and dishonored others in the past, especially bodhisattvas. Instead of feeling angry with such people, you should feel grateful to them for giving you the opportunity to purify your past misdeeds. <br/><br/>In all circumstances, it is important to act in accordance with the teachings - but especially at such moments. What is the point of having received teachings if you do not apply them? Unfavorable circumstances are the best opportunity you will have to put the teachings into practice.<br/><br/>Once a pure monk of Ratreng monastery was blamed for the theft of a lost plate. He went to see his abbot and asked him, "I am not at fault, what should I do?" The abbot advised him, "Accept the blame, offer tea to all the monks, and eventually your innocence will be proved." The monk did so. That night he had many good dreams indicating a great purification of his being. Soon after, the plate was found, and the monk cleared of the accusation. Informed of the matter, the abbot concluded, "This is the right way to behave!"<br/><br/>So, remember that whether you have a good reputation or a bad one, it has no objective reality at all. It is not worth caring about. The great teachers of the past never bothered about such things. They always answered slander and disparagement with kindness, and with patience.<br/><br/>Langri Thangpa was one such master. Once, in the region of the cave where he was meditating, there was a couple whose children always died in infancy. When yet another child was born to them, they consulted an oracle, who said that the child would survive only if they claimed that he was the son of a spiritual master. So the wife took her baby boy up to Langri Thangpa\'s cave, and set him down in front of the sage. She said, "Here is your son," and went away. The hermit said nothing about it apart from simply asking a devoted woman he knew to feed and care for the child. Sure enough, Langri Thangpa being a monk, gossip spread about him having fathered a child. A few years later, the parents of the boy came with large offerings, and respectfully said to him, "Please forgive us. Although you were not in the least at fault, we let ill rumor spread about you. The child has survived due only to you kindness." Serene as always, Langri Thangpa gave the boy back to his parents Without a word.<br/><br/>Some people spend all their energy, and even risk their lives, to achieve fame. Fame and notoriety are both no more than an empty echo. Your reputation is an alluring mirage that can easily lead you astray. Discard it without a second thought, like the snot you blow from your nose.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'The practice of dharma is like exercising or carefully following a course of training, which is powerful and deeply significant. For example, if you are in the military, you train every day. In the same way, with the dharma, you have to train your mind daily. Not just to relax but to be able to relate to whatever is happening around you. You integrate your practice with whatever conditions you meet so that you are not carried away by them and do not lose your patience.', a: '17th Karmapa'},
    {q: 'We were born alone and we will die alone. Yet even while alone we still have our shadow with us; and alone after death, our consciousness will still have with it the shadow of our actions, good and bad. By the time we are just about to enter the bardo, the intermediate state between death and birth, it will be far too late to begin our Dharma practice. But if we have already prepared ourselves, if we feel confident in our practice and know how to go to a Buddha-field, there will be no suffering in death.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Once you have reached a secluded place, try your best to abandon worldly things. Don’t think about those mundane and samsaric matters. Make sure that your body, speech, and mind are well set for the dharma practice.', a: 'Yangthang Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Devotion for the Dharma is a noble wealth that rarely arises. When devotion is aroused in a beginner, it may be stained by hope, expectation, and fear, and that’s fine for the time being. Even to have this much devotion is encouraging.<br/><br/>“Catch the wave of devotion.” Devotion is an entry point, like a wave. If you are a surfer, you don’t want to miss that wave. Once you catch it, it can carry you through your practice. So when you are first inspired by devotion, don’t wait! Catch it and use it. If devotion suddenly arises when we are in the middle of making coffee, driving home, or at any random moment, our habit is to think, “Feeling devoted like this is really good!” and make a mental note to try to practice later. What we should do instead is practice immediately, even if there is no time. <br/><br/>However short the practice has to be, do it straightaway. Even if you have time only to say a short prayer to Guru Rinpoche, do it.', a: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Many people I have met while traveling in the west are confused about why we put out "offerings" like flowers, clean water, and candles. So let me try to explain... take something as simple as a flower. When you offer the flower, hold it in your hand and think to yourself, "This flower is my realization, my potential, my accumulation of merit, all my wealth, my name, my reputation, my attachments, all the things that I would like to have in the world, all the beautiful and luxurious things, all the pleasant experiences"...basically everything that you are attached to, you offer it up, freely, without holding back. <br/>The same thing applies when you offer water. \'May the gesture of offering this water clean and purify all sentient beings negativities. By offering this water may I always remind myself of the cleansing power of compassion."<br/>When you offer a candle "May the light of this candle illuminate the darkness of ignorance and negative emotions. May the light of this candle shed light on the preciousness of my life and the truth of impermanence."<br/>When you practice like this; the flower, the water, and the candle are no longer just an ordinary object. They actually transform your motivation and become an action of generosity. This will definitely reflect back into your life in a positive way. But don\'t trust me, try it yourself and see.', a: 'Phakchok Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'The everyday practice is simply to develop a complete acceptance and openness to all situations and emotions, and to all people, experiencing everything totally without mental reservations and blockages, so that one never withdraws or centralizes into oneself.<br/><br/>This produces a tremendous energy that is usually locked up in the process of mental evasion and a general running away from life experiences.<br/><br/>Clarity of awareness may, in its initial stages, be unpleasant or fear inspiring. If so, then one should open oneself completely to the pain or the fear and welcome it. In this way the barriers created by one’s own habitual emotional reactions and prejudices are broken down.<br/><br/>When performing the meditation practice one should develop the feeling of opening oneself completely to the whole universe with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind, ridding oneself of all protecting barriers. Don’t mentally split into two when meditating, one part of the mind watching the other like a cat watching a mouse.<br/><br/>One should realize that one does not meditate to go deeply into oneself and withdraw from the world. In buddhist yoga, even when meditating on chakras there is no introspection concentration. Complete openness of mind is the essential point.<br/><br/>The ground of samsara and nirvana is the alaya, the beginning and the end of confusion and realization, the nature of universal shunyata and of all apparent phenomena. It is even more fundamental than the trikaya and is free from bias toward enlightenment. It is sometimes called the “pure” or “original” mind.<br/><br/>Although prajna (wisdom) sees in it no basis for such concepts as different aspects, the fundamental aspects of complete openness, natural perfection, and absolute spontaneity are distinguished by upaya (skillful means) as useful devices.<br/><br/>All aspects of every phenomenon are completely clear and lucid. The whole universe is open and unobstructed, everything mutually interpenetrating. Seeing all things nakedly, clear and free from obscurations, there is nothing to attain or realize. The nature of things naturally appears and is naturally present in time-transcending awareness; this is complete openness.<br/><br/>Everything is perfect just as it is, completely pure and undefiled. All phenomena naturally appear in their uniquely correct modes and situations, forming ever-changing patterns full of meaning and significance, like participants in a great dance. Everything is a symbol, yet there is no difference between the symbol and the truth symbolized. With no effort of practice whatsoever, liberation, enlightenment, and buddhahood are already fully developed and perfected. This is natural perfection.<br/><br/>The everyday practice is just ordinary life itself. Since the underdeveloped state does not exist there is no need to behave in any special way or try to attain or practice anything. There should be no feeling of striving to reach some exalted goal or higher state; this simply produces something conditional or artificial that will act as an obstruction to the free flow of the mind. One should never think of oneself as “sinful” or worthless, but as naturally pure and perfect, lacking nothing.<br/><br/>When performing meditation practice one should think of it as just a natural function of everyday living, like eating or breathing, not as a special, formal event to be undertaken with great seriousness and solemnity. One must realize that to meditate is to pass beyond effort, beyond practice, beyond aims and goals, and beyond the dualism of bondage and liberation.<br/><br/>Meditation is always perfect, so there is no need to correct anything. Since everything that arises is simply the play of the mind, there are no “bad” meditation sessions and no need to judge thoughts as good or evil. Therefore, one should not sit down to meditate with various hopes or fears about the outcome; one just does it, with no selfconscious feeling of “I am meditating,” and without attempting to control or force the mind, and without trying to become peaceful.<br/><br/>If one finds that one is going astray in any of these ways, one should stop meditating and simply rest and relax for a while before resuming.<br/><br/>If, either during or after meditation, one has experiences that one interprets as results, they should not be made into anything special. Recognize that they are just phenomena and simply observe them. Above all, do not attempt to recreate them as this opposes the natural spontaneity of the mind. All phenomena are completely new and fresh and absolutely unique, entirely free from all concepts of past, present, and future—as if experienced in another dimension of time; this is absolute spontaneity.<br/><br/>The continual stream of new discovery and fresh revelation and inspiration that arises at every moment is the manifestation of the eternal youth of the living dharma and its wonders; splendor and spontaneity is the play or dance aspect of the universe as guru.<br/><br/>One should learn to see everyday life as a mandala in which one is at the center, and be free of the bias and prejudice of past conditioning, present desires, and hopes and expectations about the future.<br/><br/>The figures of the mandala are the day-to-day objects of one’s life experiences moving in the great dance of the play of the universe, the symbolism by which the guru reveals profound and ultimate meaning and significance. Therefore, be natural and spontaneous; accept and learn from everything.<br/><br/>See the comical, amusing side of initiating situations. In meditation, see through the illusion of past, present, and future. The past is but a present memory or condition, the future but a present projection, and the present itself vanishes before it can be grasped.<br/><br/>One should put an end to conceptions about meditation and free oneself from memories of the past. Each moment of meditation is completely unique and full of potentiality of new discovery, so one is incapable of judging meditation by past experience or by theory.<br/><br/>Simply plunge straight into meditation at this very moment with your whole mind, and be free from hesitation, boredom, or excitement.<br/><br/>When meditating it is traditional and best, if possible, to sit cross-legged with the back erect but not rigid. However, it is most important to feel comfortable, so it is better to sit in a chair if sitting cross-legged is painful.<br/><br/>One’s mental attitude should be inspired by the three fundamental aspects, whether the meditation is with or without form, and it may often prove desirable, if not essential, to precede a period of formless meditation by a period of meditation with form.<br/><br/>To provide for this eventuality many classes of preliminary meditation practices have been developed over centuries of buddhist practice, the most important being meditations on breathing, mantra recitation, and visualization techniques.<br/><br/>To engage in the second and third of these classes, personal instruction from one’s guru is required, but a few words on the first would not be out of place here as the method used varies little from person to person.<br/><br/>First, let the mind follow the movement of the breath, in and out, until it becomes calm and tranquil. Then increasingly rest the mind on the breath until one’s whole being seems to be identified with it.<br/><br/>Finally, become aware of the breath leaving the body and going out into space, and gradually transfer the attention from the breath to the sensation of spaciousness and expansion. By letting this final sensation merge into complete openness, one moves into the sphere of formless meditation.<br/><br/>In all probability the above description of the three fundamental aspects will seem vague and inadequate. This is inevitable since they attempt to describe what is not only beyond words but beyond thought as well. They invite practice of what is, essentially, a state of being.<br/><br/>The words are simply a form of upaya, skillful means, a hint which, if acted upon, will enable one’s innate natural wisdom and naturally perfect action to arise spontaneously.<br/><br/>Sometimes in meditation one may experience a gap in one’s normal consciousness, a sudden and complete openness. This experience arises only when one has ceased to think in terms of meditation and the object of meditation. It is a glimpse of reality, a sudden flash that occurs infrequently at first, and then, with continued practice, more and more frequently. It may not be a particularly shattering or explosive experience at all, just a moment of great simplicity.<br/><br/>Do not make the mistake of deliberately trying to force these experiences to recur, for to do so is to betray the naturalness and spontaneity of reality.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Always remember that how we react to every moment of our life will reinforce either our negative habits or positive habits.

In prison, I had the opportunity to actually practice, taking external hardships onto the path with patient forbearance. Not a single time did I hope to become free from prison, I lived day by day, free of hopes and fears, sending compassion to beings, relying on Tara, praying to her secretly.

    {q: 'When the Kadam master Gönpawa was on his deathbed, we are told, he gave the following four brief counsels to his grieving disciple Phuchungwa:<br/>Teach others what you practice;<br/>practice what you preach;<br/>even at a place where you might be staying for a single day, do not act as an outside guest but constantly remember your teachers and their instructions;<br/>and always cultivate limitless loving-kindness toward other sentient beings.<br/><br/>Once again, in a few simple lines we see important universal spiritual principles echoed with great efficiency. <br/><br/>“Teach others what you practice” underlines the important ethos that we should only teach others things that we ourselves have gained some degree of mastery in. In spiritual matters, it shouldn’t be the case of the blind leading the blind. <br/><br/>“Practice what you preach” encapsulates the important principle that, in matters of spiritual practice, the teacher is as much a student as his disciples. This line echoes one of the four factors of sustaining other’s minds—namely, “acting in accord with your own advice.” <br/><br/>The advice that we should not act as an outside guest even at a place where we might happen to stay only for a day makes the point that when it comes to mindful awareness, there is no place or occasion for exceptions. A true spiritual practitioner will not use being away from his or her normal meditative environment as an excuse for laxity. <br/><br/>Finally, Master Gönpawa reminds us that at the end of the day what matters most is caring for the needs and welfare of other sentient beings — the practice of loving-kindness.', a: 'Thubten Jinpa'},

I also tells us the dirt is washable and that the dirt itself is not the cup.<br/><br/>That is the quintessence of the refuge.<br/><br/>If you don\'t have an insight into the quintessential refuge, you will have no confidence in taking refuge to the Buddha. For example, when a mother, who happens to have housekeeping experience, tells her son or daughter to wash a cup, this mother has confidence. She knows the dirt and the cup are separate entities. That is why a mother or father has this confidence to say. "Go and wash the cup."<br/><br/>Likewise at the vajrayana and mahayana level, the theory tells us we are the Buddha, and the buddha nature is within us. This dirt that we have is only temporal. Accepting and knowing this is the quintessence of the refuge.<br/><br/>That is the theory of refuge.', a: 'Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'The benefits of meditating day and night just on death and impermanence are said to be boundless. One sees that everything that appears is perishable and thereby gains a deep sense of nonattachment to outer objects. The fire of diligence in the performance of positive actions is set ablaze. One begins to feel an uncommon and heartfelt fear of the sufferings of cyclic existence. <br/><br/>From recognizing that at the time of death nothing can help one, one gives up the activities of this life. One uses one’s body, speech, and mind to practice the Dharma, without taking even a moment of ordinary leisure. One sees how actions mature as results, and this gives rise to determination to be free and disenchantment. <br/><br/>As one knows that the time of death is unpredictable, one does not count on anything. Numerous virtues that one did not have before are born in one’s mindstream. One stops believing things are eternal. One does not have attachment to friends and relations or hatred for enemies. One is constantly diligent in performing positive actions. One understands that life is a delusion. One completes the two accumulations of merit and wisdom, and so on. <br/><br/>The Nirvana Sutra says:<br/><br/>Of all the various kinds of cultivation, reaping the autumn crop is the best;<br/>Of all footprints, that of the elephant is the biggest;<br/>Of all thoughts, that of impermanence and death is the greatest:<br/>It stops all thoughts involved with the three worlds.<br/><br/>The Great Master says:<br/><br/>To obtain the freedoms and advantages is scarcely possible, but even if you do,<br/>There’s no knowing when you’ll die, for death, like lightning’s play, is unpredictable.<br/>With each day, each hour, life is running out,<br/>So don’t defer the practice, Child of my Speech.<br/><br/>Nagarjuna writes:<br/><br/>As if your hair or clothes had just caught fire,<br/>Abandon all to put a stop to this,<br/>And do your best to not be born again:<br/>No greater goal or need is there than that.<br/><br/>And Padampa Sangye:<br/><br/>If first you finish what you have to do, you’ll never get to Dharma;<br/>People of Tingri, while you’re thinking of it, practice straight away.<br/><br/>So reject all the superficial things of this world as though it were so much spit in the dust and practice the perfectly pure, sacred Buddhadharma according to the instructions of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Thinking, “That I might be able to do so, precious teacher, in you I put my trust!” earnestly recite the following prayer.<br/><br/>The perceptions of this life are just temporary conditions, like a dream:<br/>May I be deeply mindful of impermanence and death.<br/>As I pray to you, precious teacher,<br/>Bless me, incomparably kind lord.', a: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Whatever practices we do, whether the common ones of taking refuge and making prostrations, the various trainings in bodhichitta, the methods for purifying the defilements of body and speech, or the uncommon practices of the Secret Mantra (the visualization and recitation of Vajrasattva, guru yoga, or meditation on the yidam deity), all that we do—and this is very important—should be accompanied by the three “supreme methods.”<br/><br/>The first of these methods is the attitude of bodhichitta. All beings possess the <br/>tathagatagarbha, the seed of buddhahood, but this is obscured and veiled. As a result, they wander in samsara. The first method is therefore to be determined to liberate them from this ocean of suffering.<br/><br/>The second supreme method is to have a mind free from conceptualization, which means to practice without distraction. Even if we make only a single prostration, we should not just go through the motions mechanically, with our thoughts and words elsewhere. On the contrary, we should practice with a concentrated mind, and never be carried away by distraction.<br/><br/>The third supreme method is to conclude with dedication. Whatever merit has been generated must be dedicated for the sake of beings, who are as many as the sky is vast. In fact, if we forget to round off our practice with the excellent attitude of bodhichitta, dedicating the merit to others, this merit could be destroyed in a moment of strong anger or defilement.<br/><br/>For this reason, all positive actions should immediately be followed by an act of dedication for the welfare of all beings. The benefits of this supreme method are immense; dedication renders merit inexhaustible and causes it to increase constantly.', a: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Most people, thinking of the future, make a lot of plans—but the future they plan for is only the very few years of this life. This is very shortsighted; we have such a long way to go in lives to come. Death is just the threshold, which we have to cross alone, aided only by our faith in the teacher and the Three Jewels and by our confidence in the practice. Relatives, friends, power, wealth, and whatever else we have become so used to relying on will simply no longer be there.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Just as every single thing is always moving inexorably closer to its ultimate dissolution, so also your own life, like a burning butter-lamp, will soon be consumed. It would be foolish to think that you can first finish all your work and then retire to spend the later stages of your life practicing the Dharma. Can you be certain that you will live that long? Does death not strike the young as well as the old? No matter what you are doing, therefore, remember death and keep your mind focused on the Dharma.', a: 'Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Where is this self-clinging? That which clings to “I” is the mind; that which clings to “other” is also the mind. So the next question is: Where is the mind? It must be somehow in the body because when the mind is not present, we have only a corpse. So ask yourself, is it in the top part of the body or the lower part? How big is it? What color is it? If you pull a hair out of your head, it hurts, doesn’t it? If you prick your foot on a thorn, it hurts, doesn’t it? The mind and body must be somehow coextensive, mustn’t they? It’s as though the mind and body were stuck to each other. On the other hand, when someone is killed in an accident, where does the mind go? How did it leave the body and from where? It’s only when we examine the mind correctly that we discover how many false assumptions we have—false assumptions that, for the moment, are completely unnoticed. We cling to things as though they were permanent and will last forever. This is the measure of our delusion, tightly fettered as we are by this so-called “I” of ours—this “I,” in the interests of which, our mind enslaves our body and our speech, and creates all sorts of difficulties and hardships. When we arrive at a correct understanding of the mind, we can see that our present thoughts are just like waves on the water. At one moment they arise; at another, they dissolve. And that’s all there is to it: the mind is nothing but thoughts. The mind, which is empty, arises as thought, and this is also empty. The stream of consciousness, which is empty, is carried away by thoughts that are likewise empty. This is how the mind falls and remains in the six realms of samsara. It is the mind itself that fabricates samsara, and it does so because it fails to recognize its own nature. Now that we have some idea of the mind’s nature and how it works, we must bring it under control and master it. In order to do this, it is said that we must keep our body perfectly still. Moreover, if the body is straight, the subtle channels will be straight. If the subtle channels are straight, the wind-energy will be unobstructed. And if the wind-energy is unobstructed, the mind will rest in its natural, unaltered flow. Therefore, keep your body still and reduce your speech to a minimum. Don’t think about what you have just been doing. Don’t think about what you are going to do later. Without concern for the past or the future, let your mind rest in its natural state. This state, in which the mind is left as it is, untampered with and natural, is called “rest” or “stillness.” This “stillness” is actually just the mind itself. You could call it the “mind of the present moment,” or the “awareness of the present moment.” But whatever you call it, it is what—in this very moment—is actually knowing and joyfully aware.', a: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Those with faith will go for refuge;<br/>Those who have compassion will have bodhichitta;<br/>Those with wisdom will gain realization;<br/>Those who have devotion harvest blessings.', a: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
    {q: 'Peaceful self-control: the sign of one who’s heard the teachings!<br/>Few defiled emotions are the mark of one who meditates.<br/>Harmony with others is the sign of one who practices.<br/>A blissful heart is witness to accomplishment.<br/>The root of Dharma is your very mind.<br/>Tame it and you’re practicing the Dharma.<br/>To practice Dharma is to tame your mind<br/>And when you tame it, then you will be free!', a: 'Dudjom Rinpoche'},
